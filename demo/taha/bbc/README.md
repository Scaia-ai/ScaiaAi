This is where the BBC data is supposed to go.

please extract the bbc.rar into bbc directory files in bbc directory, the contents must be like this:

bbc
-config.json
-pytorch_model.bin
-vocab.txt

note: the attached file dose not contain the `pytorch_model.bin` , it's about 425Mb and you should download it from huggingface's server, and rename it to the pytorch_model.bin.

if there was any problem use these links:
