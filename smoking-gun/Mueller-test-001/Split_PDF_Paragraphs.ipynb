R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\nINTRODUCTION TO VOLUME I \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThis report is submitted to the Attorney General pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 600.8(c), which \\nstates that, “[a]t the conclusion of the Special Counsel’s work, he . . . shall provide the Attorney \\nGeneral  a  confidential  report  explaining  the  prosecution  or  declination  decisions  [the  Special \\nCounsel] reached.” \\n \\n\\nThe  Russian  government  interfered  in  the  2016  presidential  election  in  sweeping  and \\nsystematic fashion.  Evidence of Russian government operations began to surface in mid-2016.  In \\nJune, the Democratic National Committee and its cyber response team publicly announced that \\nRussian hackers had compromised its computer network.  Releases of hacked materials—hacks \\nthat  public  reporting  soon  attributed  to  the  Russian  government—began  that  same  month. \\nAdditional releases followed in July through the organization WikiLeaks, with further releases in \\n \\nOctober and November.     \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn  late  July  2016,  soon  after  WikiLeaks’s  first  release  of  stolen  documents,  a  foreign \\ngovernment contacted the FBI about a May 2016 encounter with Trump Campaign foreign policy \\nadvisor George Papadopoulos.  Papadopoulos had suggested to a representative of that foreign \\ngovernment that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that \\nit  could  assist  the  Campaign  through  the  anonymous  release  of  information  damaging  to \\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.  That information prompted the FBI on July \\n31, 2016, to open an investigation into whether individuals associated with the Trump Campaign \\nwere coordinating with the Russian government in its interference activities. \\n\\n \\nThat fall, two federal agencies jointly announced that the Russian government “directed \\nrecent  compromises  of  e-mails  from  US  persons  and  institutions,  including  US  political \\norganizations,” and, “[t]hese thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election \\n \\nprocess.” After the election, in late December 2016, the United States imposed sanctions on Russia \\nfor  having  interfered  in  the  election.  By  early  2017,  several  congressional  committees  were \\nexamining Russia’s interference in the election.    \\n\\n \\nWithin the Executive Branch, these investigatory efforts ultimately led to the May 2017 \\nappointment of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III.  The order appointing the Special Counsel \\nauthorized  him  to  investigate  “the  Russian  government’s  efforts  to  interfere  in  the  2016 \\npresidential election,” including any links or coordination between the Russian government and \\nindividuals associated with the Trump Campaign.   \\n\\n \\nAs set forth in detail in this report, the Special Counsel’s investigation established that \\nRussia interfered in the 2016 presidential election principally through two operations.  First, a \\nRussian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. \\nTrump  and  disparaged  presidential  candidate  Hillary  Clinton.  Second,  a  Russian  intelligence \\nservice  conducted  computer-intrusion  operations  against  entities,  employees,  and  volunteers \\n \\nworking on the Clinton Campaign and then released stolen documents.  The investigation also \\nidentified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump Campaign.

In some instances, the report points out \\nthe absence of evidence or conflicts in the evidence about a particular fact or event.  In other \\n \\ninstances,  when  substantial,  credible  evidence  enabled  the  Office  to  reach  a  conclusion  with \\n \\nconfidence,  the  report  states  that  the  investigation  established  that  certain  actions  or  events \\n \\noccurred.  A statement that the investigation did not establish particular facts does not mean there \\nwas no evidence of those facts. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nIn evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted \\na crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of “collusion.”  In so doing, \\nthe  Office  recognized  that  the  word  “collud[e]”  was  used  in  communications  with  the  Acting \\n \\nAttorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation’s scope and that the term has \\nfrequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation.  But collusion is not a specific \\noffense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal \\ncriminal law.  For those reasons, the Office’s focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability \\n \\nwas on conspiracy as defined in federal law.  In connection with that analysis, we addressed the \\nfactual question whether members of the Trump Campaign “coordinat[ed]”—a term that appears \\nin  the  appointment  order—with  Russian  election  interference  activities.  Like  collusion, \\n \\n“coordination”  does  not  have  a  settled  definition  in  federal  criminal  law.  We  understood \\ncoordination to require an agreement—tacit or express—between the Trump Campaign and the \\nRussian  government  on  election  interference.   That  requires  more  than  the  two  parties  taking \\n \\nactions that were informed by or responsive to the other’s actions or interests.  We applied the term \\ncoordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the \\nTrump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. \\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n*  *  * \\n\\n \\n\\nThe report on our investigation consists of two volumes: \\n \\nVolume I describes the factual results of the Special Counsel’s investigation of Russia’s \\ninterference  in  the  2016  presidential  election  and  its  interactions  with  the  Trump  Campaign.  \\nSection I describes the scope of the investigation.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0cEXECUTIVE SUMMARY TO VOLUME I \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nRUSSIAN SOCIAL  MEDIA  CAMPAIGN     \\n \\nThe  Internet  Research  Agency  (IRA)  carried  out  the  earliest  Russian  interference \\noperations  identified  by  the  investigation—a  social  media  campaign  designed  to  provoke  and \\namplify political and social discord in the United States.  The IRA was based in St. Petersburg, \\n \\nRussia,  and  received  funding  from   Russian  oligarch  Yevgeniy  Prigozhin  and  companies  he  \\ncontrolled.  Prigozhin is widely reported to have ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\nmission with instructions \\n\\n \\nIn mid-2014, the IRA sent employees to the United States on an intelligence-gathering \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\nThe IRA later used social media accounts and interest groups to sow discord in the U.S. \\npolitical system through what it termed “information warfare.”  The campaign evolved from a \\n \\ngeneralized  program designed  in  2014  and  2015  to  undermine  the  U.S.  electoral  system,  to  a \\n \\ntargeted operation that by early 2016 favored candidate Trump and disparaged candidate Clinton. \\n  \\nThe IRA’s operation also included the purchase of political advertisements on social media in the \\nnames of U.S. persons and entities, as well as the staging of political rallies inside the United \\n \\nStates.  To organize those rallies, IRA employees posed as U.S. grassroots entities and persons and \\nmade contact with Trump supporters and Trump Campaign officials in the United States.  The \\ninvestigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons conspired or coordinated with the \\nIRA.  Section  II  of  this  report  details  the  Office’s  investigation  of  the  Russian  social  media \\n \\ncampaign.   \\n\\n \\nRUSSIAN HACKING OPERATIONS   \\n \\n \\nAt the same time that the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Trump in \\nearly 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference:  cyber intrusions \\n(hacking)  and  releases  of  hacked  materials  damaging  to  the  Clinton  Campaign.  The  Russian \\nintelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian \\n \\nArmy (GRU) carried out these operations.   \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn  March  2016,  the  GRU  began  hacking  the  email  accounts  of  Clinton  Campaign \\nvolunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta.  In April 2016, the GRU \\nhacked  into  the  computer  networks  of  the  Democratic  Congressional  Campaign  Committee \\n(DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC).  The GRU stole hundreds of thousands \\nof documents from the compromised email accounts and networks.  Around the time that the DNC \\nannounced in  mid-June 2016  the  Russian  government’s  role  in  hacking  its  network,  the  GRU \\nbegan  disseminating  stolen  materials  through  the  fictitious  online  personas  “DCLeaks”  and \\n“Guccifer 2.0.”  The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n4 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)Harm to Ongoing MatterHarm to Ongoing Matter\\x0c \\n \\nThe  presidential  campaign  of  Donald  J.  Trump  (“Trump  Campaign”   or  “Campaign”) \\nshowed interest in WikiLeaks’s releases of  documents and welcomed their potential to damage \\ncandidate Clinton.  Beginning in June 2016, \\n forecast to \\nsenior  Campaign  officials  that  WikiLeaks  would  release  information  damaging  to  candidate \\nClinton.  WikiLeaks’s first release came  in July 2016.  Around the  same time, candidate Trump  \\nannounced that he hoped Russia would recover emails described as missing from  a  private server \\nused by Clinton when she was Secretary of State (he later said that he was speaking sarcastically). \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\nWikiLeaks  began  releasing \\nPodesta’s stolen emails on October 7, 2016, less than one hour after a U.S. media outlet released \\nvideo considered damaging to candidate Trump.  Section III of this Report details the Office’s \\ninvestigation into the Russian hacking operations, as well as other efforts by Trump Campaign \\nsupporters to obtain Clinton-related emails.      \\n\\n \\n \\nRUSSIAN CONTACTS WITH THE CAMPAIGN   \\n \\nThe social media campaign and the GRU hacking operations coincided with a series of \\ncontacts between Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government.  \\nThe Office investigated whether those contacts reflected or resulted in the Campaign conspiring \\nor  coordinating  with  Russia  in  its  election-interference  activities.  Although  the  investigation \\nestablished that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and \\nworked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from \\ninformation stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that \\nmembers of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its \\nelection interference activities. \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\nThe  Russian  contacts  consisted  of  business  connections,  offers  of  assistance  to  the \\nCampaign, invitations for candidate Trump and Putin to meet in person, invitations for Campaign \\nofficials  and  representatives  of  the  Russian  government  to  meet,  and  policy  positions  seeking \\nimproved U.S.-Russian relations.  Section IV of this Report details the contacts between Russia \\nand the Trump Campaign during the campaign and transition periods, the most salient of which \\n   \\nare summarized below in chronological order. \\n\\n \\n2015.  Some of the earliest contacts were made in connection with a Trump Organization \\nreal-estate project in Russia known as Trump Tower Moscow.  Candidate Trump signed a Letter \\nof Intent for Trump Tower Moscow by November 2015, and in January 2016 Trump Organization \\nexecutive  Michael  Cohen  emailed  and  spoke  about  the  project  with  the  office  of  Russian \\ngovernment press secretary Dmitry Peskov.  The Trump Organization pursued the project through \\nat least June 2016, including by considering travel to Russia by Cohen and candidate Trump.   \\n\\n \\nSpring 2016.  Campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos made early contact \\nwith Joseph Mifsud, a London-based professor who had connections to Russia and traveled to \\nMoscow  in  April  2016.  Immediately  upon  his  return  to  London  from  that  trip,  Mifsud  told \\nPapadopoulos that the Russian government had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n5 \\n\\n \\n\\nHarm to Ongoing MatterU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)Harm to Ongoing Matter\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nof  emails.  One  week  later,  in  the  first  week  of  May  2016,  Papadopoulos  suggested  to  a \\nrepresentative of a foreign government that the Trump Campaign had received indications from \\nthe  Russian  government  that  it  could  assist  the  Campaign  through  the  anonymous  release  of \\ninformation damaging to candidate Clinton.  Throughout that period of time and for several months \\n \\nthereafter, Papadopoulos worked with Mifsud and two Russian nationals to arrange a meeting \\nbetween the Campaign and the Russian government.  No meeting took place. \\n \\n\\nSummer 2016.  Russian outreach to the Trump Campaign continued into the summer of \\n2016, as candidate Trump was becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for President.  On \\nJune 9, 2016, for example, a Russian lawyer met with senior Trump Campaign officials Donald \\nTrump  Jr.,  Jared  Kushner,  and  campaign  chairman  Paul  Manafort  to  deliver  what  the  email \\nproposing  the  meeting  had  described  as  “official  documents  and  information  that  would \\nincriminate  Hillary.”  The  materials  were  offered  to  Trump  Jr.  as  “part  of  Russia  and  its \\ngovernment’s  support  for  Mr.  Trump.”  The  written  communications  setting  up  the  meeting \\nshowed  that  the  Campaign  anticipated  receiving  information  from  Russia  that  could  assist \\ncandidate Trump’s electoral prospects, but the Russian lawyer’s presentation did not provide such \\ninformation.  \\n\\n \\nDays  after  the  June  9  meeting,  on  June  14,  2016,  a  cybersecurity  firm  and  the  DNC \\n \\nannounced  that  Russian  government  hackers  had  infiltrated  the  DNC  and  obtained  access  to \\n  \\nopposition research on candidate Trump, among other documents. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIn July 2016, Campaign foreign policy advisor Carter Page traveled in his personal capacity \\n \\nto Moscow and gave the keynote address at the New Economic School.  Page had lived and worked \\nin Russia between 2003 and 2007.  After returning to the United States, Page became acquainted \\nwith  at  least  two  Russian  intelligence  officers,  one  of  whom  was  later  charged  in  2015  with \\nconspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of Russia.  Page’s July 2016 trip to Moscow and his \\n \\nadvocacy for pro-Russian foreign policy drew media attention. The Campaign then distanced itself \\nfrom Page and, by late September 2016, removed him from the Campaign.  \\n\\n \\nJuly 2016 was also the month WikiLeaks first released emails stolen by the GRU from the \\n \\nDNC.  On  July  22,  2016,  WikiLeaks  posted  thousands  of  internal  DNC  documents  revealing \\n \\ninformation  about  the  Clinton  Campaign.  Within  days,  there  was  public  reporting  that  U.S. \\nintelligence agencies had “high confidence” that the Russian government was behind the theft of \\nemails and documents from the DNC.  And within a week of the release, a foreign government \\n \\ninformed the FBI about its May 2016 interaction with Papadopoulos and his statement that the \\n \\nRussian government could assist the Trump Campaign.  On July 31, 2016, based on the foreign \\ngovernment reporting, the FBI opened an investigation into potential coordination between the \\nRussian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign. \\n\\n \\nSeparately, on August 2, 2016, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort met in New York \\nCity with his long-time business associate Konstantin Kilimnik, who the FBI assesses to have ties \\nto Russian intelligence.  Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a peace plan for \\nUkraine that Manafort acknowledged to the Special Counsel’s Office was a “backdoor” way for \\n \\nRussia to control part of eastern Ukraine; both men believed the plan would require candidate \\nTrump’s assent to succeed (were he to be elected President).  They also discussed the status of the \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n6 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nTrump Campaign and Manafort’s strategy for winning Democratic votes in Midwestern states.  \\nMonths before that meeting, Manafort had caused internal polling data to be shared with Kilimnik, \\n \\nand the sharing continued for some period of time after their August meeting. \\n\\n \\nFall 2016.  On October 7, 2016, the media released video of candidate Trump speaking in \\n \\ngraphic terms about women years earlier, which was considered damaging to his candidacy.  Less \\nthan an hour later, WikiLeaks made its second release:  thousands of John Podesta’s emails that \\nhad been stolen by the GRU in late March 2016.  The FBI and other U.S. government institutions \\nwere at the time continuing their investigation of suspected Russian government efforts to interfere \\nin the presidential election.  That same day, October 7, the Department of Homeland Security and \\nthe Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a joint public statement “that the Russian \\nGovernment  directed  the  recent  compromises  of  e-mails  from  US  persons  and  institutions, \\nincluding from US political organizations.”  Those “thefts” and the “disclosures” of the hacked \\nmaterials through online platforms such as WikiLeaks, the statement continued, “are intended to \\ninterfere with the US election process.” \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n  \\nPost-2016  Election.  Immediately  after  the  November  8  election,  Russian  government \\n \\nofficials  and  prominent  Russian  businessmen  began  trying  to  make  inroads  into  the  new \\nadministration.  The most senior levels of the Russian government encouraged these efforts.  The \\nRussian Embassy made contact hours after the election to congratulate the President-Elect and to \\narrange a call with President Putin.  Several Russian businessmen picked up the effort from there.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nKirill Dmitriev, the chief executive officer of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, was among \\nthe Russians who tried to make contact with the incoming administration.  In early December, a \\nbusiness associate steered Dmitriev to Erik Prince, a supporter of the Trump Campaign and an \\nassociate of senior Trump advisor Steve Bannon.  Dmitriev and Prince later met face-to-face in \\n \\nJanuary 2017 in the Seychelles and discussed U.S.-Russia relations.  During the same period, \\nanother business associate introduced Dmitriev to a friend of Jared Kushner who had not served \\non the Campaign or the Transition Team.  Dmitriev and Kushner’s friend collaborated on a short \\n \\nwritten reconciliation plan for the United States and Russia, which Dmitriev implied had been \\ncleared through Putin.  The friend gave that proposal to Kushner before the inauguration, and \\nKushner later gave copies to Bannon and incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. \\n \\n\\n \\nOn December 29, 2016, then-President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for having \\ninterfered  in the  election.  Incoming  National  Security  Advisor Michael  Flynn  called  Russian \\nAmbassador  Sergey  Kislyak  and  asked  Russia  not  to  escalate  the  situation  in  response  to  the \\nsanctions.  The following day, Putin announced that Russia would not take retaliatory measures in \\nresponse to the sanctions at that time.  Hours later, President-Elect Trump tweeted, “Great move \\n \\non delay (by V. Putin).”  The next day, on December 31, 2016, Kislyak called Flynn and told him \\n \\nthe request had been received at the highest levels and Russia had chosen not to retaliate as a result \\nof Flynn’s request. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n* * * \\n\\n \\nOn January 6, 2017, members of the intelligence community briefed President-Elect Trump \\non a joint assessment—drafted and coordinated among the Central Intelligence Agency, FBI, and \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n7 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n \\nNational Security Agency—that concluded with high confidence that Russia had intervened in the \\n \\nelection  through  a  variety  of  means  to  assist  Trump’s  candidacy  and  harm  Clinton’s.\\n  A \\ndeclassified version of the assessment was publicly released that same day.     \\n\\n \\n \\nBetween mid-January 2017 and early February 2017, three congressional committees—the \\nHouse Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), the Senate Select Committee on \\nIntelligence  (SSCI),  and  the  Senate  Judiciary  Committee  (SJC)—announced  that  they  would \\n \\nconduct  inquiries,  or  had  already  been  conducting  inquiries,  into  Russian  interference  in  the \\n \\nelection.  Then-FBI Director James Comey later confirmed to Congress the existence of the FBI’s \\ninvestigation into Russian interference that had begun before the election.  On March 20, 2017, in \\nopen-session testimony before HPSCI, Comey stated: \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nI have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part \\nof our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government’s efforts \\nto  interfere  in  the  2016  presidential  election,  and  that  includes  investigating  the \\nnature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and \\nthe  Russian  government  and  whether  there  was  any  coordination  between  the \\ncampaign and Russia’s efforts. . . .  As with any counterintelligence investigation, \\nthis will also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\nThe investigation continued under then-Director Comey for the next seven weeks until May 9, \\n2017,  when  President  Trump  fired  Comey  as  FBI  Director—an  action  which  is  analyzed  in \\nVolume II of the report.  \\n \\n\\nOn May 17, 2017, Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed the Special Counsel \\n \\nand authorized him to conduct the investigation that Comey had confirmed in his congressional \\n \\ntestimony, as well as matters arising directly from the investigation, and any other matters within \\n \\nthe scope of 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a), which generally covers efforts to interfere with or obstruct the \\ninvestigation. \\n\\n \\nPresident Trump reacted negatively to the Special Counsel’s appointment. He told advisors \\nthat it was the end of his presidency, sought to have Attorney General Jefferson (Jeff) Sessions \\nunrecuse from the Russia investigation and to have the Special Counsel removed, and engaged in \\n \\nefforts to curtail the Special Counsel’s investigation and prevent the disclosure of evidence to it, \\nincluding through public and private contacts with potential witnesses.  Those and related actions \\nare described and analyzed in Volume II of the report.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nTHE SPECIAL COUNSEL’S CHARGING DECISIONS \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n* * * \\n\\n \\n\\nIn  reaching  the  charging  decisions  described  in  Volume  I  of  the  report,  the  Office \\ndetermined  whether  the  conduct  it  found  amounted  to  a  violation  of  federal  criminal  law \\nchargeable under the Principles of Federal Prosecution.  See Justice Manual § 9-27.000 et seq. \\n \\n(2018).  The standard set forth in the Justice Manual is whether the conduct constitutes a crime; if \\nso, whether admissible evidence would probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction; \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n8 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\nand whether prosecution would serve a substantial federal interest that could not be adequately \\nserved by prosecution elsewhere or through non-criminal alternatives.  See Justice Manual § 9-\\n27.220. \\n \\nSection V of the report provides detailed explanations of the Office’s charging decisions, \\n\\nwhich contain three main components. \\n \\n \\nFirst, the Office determined that Russia’s two principal interference operations in the 2016 \\nU.S. presidential election—the social media campaign and the hacking-and-dumping operations— \\nviolated U.S. criminal law.  Many of the individuals and entities involved in the social media \\ncampaign have been charged with participating in a conspiracy to defraud the United States by \\n \\nundermining through deceptive acts the work of federal agencies charged with regulating foreign \\ninfluence in U.S. elections, as well as related counts of identity theft.  See United States v. Internet \\nResearch Agency, et al., No. 18-cr-32 (D.D.C.).  Separately, Russian intelligence officers who \\ncarried  out  the  hacking  into  Democratic  Party  computers  and  the  personal  email  accounts  of \\nindividuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign conspired to violate, among other federal laws, \\nthe  federal  computer-intrusion  statute,  and  they   have  been  so  charged.    See   United  States   v.  \\n \\nNetyksho, et al., No. 18-cr-215 (D.D.C.).  \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n    \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n      \\nSecond, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to \\nthe Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was \\n \\nnot sufficient to support criminal charges.  Among other things, the evidence was not sufficient to \\ncharge any Campaign official as an unregistered agent of the Russian government or other Russian \\n \\nprincipal.  And our evidence about the June 9, 2016 meeting and WikiLeaks’s releases of hacked \\nmaterials was not sufficient to charge a criminal campaign-finance violation.  Further, the evidence \\nwas  not  sufficient  to  charge  that  any  member  of  the  Trump  Campaign  conspired  with \\nrepresentatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.  \\n\\n \\nThird,  the  investigation  established  that  several  individuals  affiliated  with  the  Trump \\nCampaign  lied  to  the  Office,  and  to  Congress,  about  their  interactions  with  Russian-affiliated \\n \\nindividuals  and  related  matters.  Those  lies  materially  impaired  the  investigation  of  Russian \\nelection interference.  The Office charged some of those lies as violations of the federal false-\\nstatements statute.  Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about \\n \\nhis  interactions  with  Russian  Ambassador  Kislyak  during  the  transition  period.  George \\nPapadopoulos, a foreign policy advisor during the campaign period, pleaded guilty to lying to \\ninvestigators about, inter alia, the nature and timing of his interactions with Joseph Mifsud, the \\nprofessor who told Papadopoulos that the Russians had dirt on candidate Clinton in the form of \\nthousands  of  emails.    Former  Trump  Organization  attorney  Michael  Cohen  pleaded   guilty  to  \\n \\nmaking false statements to Congress about the Trump Moscow project.  \\n \\n \\n  And in February 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found that  \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n9 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

For  example,  the  investigation  established  that  interactions \\nbetween Russian Ambassador Kislyak and Trump Campaign officials both at the candidate’s April \\n2016 foreign policy speech in Washington, D.C., and during the week of the Republican National \\nConvention were brief, public, and non-substantive.  And the investigation did not establish that \\none Campaign official’s efforts to dilute a portion of the Republican Party platform on providing \\nassistance  to  Ukraine  were  undertaken  at  the  behest  of  candidate  Trump  or  Russia.  The \\n \\ninvestigation also did not establish that a meeting between Kislyak and Sessions in September \\n2016 at Sessions’s Senate office included any more than a passing mention of the presidential \\ncampaign.  \\n\\n \\nThe investigation did not always yield admissible information or testimony, or a complete \\npicture of the activities undertaken by subjects of the investigation.  Some individuals invoked \\ntheir Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination and were not, in the Office’s \\n \\njudgment, appropriate candidates for grants of immunity.  The Office limited its pursuit of other \\n \\nwitnesses and information—such as information known to attorneys or individuals claiming to be \\nmembers  of  the  media—in  light  of  internal  Department  of  Justice  policies.  See,  e.g.,  Justice \\nManual §§ 9-13.400, 13.410.  Some of the information obtained via court process, moreover, was \\npresumptively  covered  by  legal  privilege  and  was  screened  from  investigators  by  a  filter  (or \\n“taint”)  team.  Even  when  individuals  testified  or  agreed  to  be  interviewed,  they  sometimes \\nprovided information that was false or incomplete, leading to some of the false-statements charges \\ndescribed above.  And the Office faced practical limits on its ability to access relevant evidence as \\nwell—numerous witnesses and subjects lived abroad, and documents were held outside the United \\nStates. \\n\\n \\n \\nFurther, the Office learned that some of the individuals we interviewed or whose conduct \\nwe  investigated—including  some  associated  with  the  Trump  Campaign—deleted  relevant \\ncommunications  or  communicated  during  the  relevant  period  using  applications  that  feature \\n \\nencryption or that do not provide for long-term retention of data or communications records.  In \\n \\nsuch  cases,  the  Office  was  not  able  to  corroborate  witness  statements  through  comparison  to \\ncontemporaneous  communications  or  fully  question  witnesses  about  statements  that  appeared \\ninconsistent with other known facts. \\n\\n \\nAccordingly, while this report embodies factual and legal determinations that the Office \\nbelieves to be accurate and complete to the greatest extent possible, given these identified gaps, \\nthe Office cannot rule out the possibility that the unavailable information would shed additional \\nlight on (or cast in a new light) the events described in the report.   \\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n10 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0cI.  THE SPECIAL COUNSEL’S INVESTIGATION \\n \\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nOn May 17, 2017, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein—then serving as Acting \\nAttorney General for the Russia investigation following the recusal of former Attorney General \\n \\nJeff  Sessions  on  March  2,  2016—appointed  the  Special  Counsel  “to  investigate  Russian \\ninterference with the 2016 presidential election and related matters.”  Office of the Deputy Att’y \\nGen., Order No. 3915-2017, Appointment of Special Counsel to Investigate Russian Interference \\nwith the 2016 Presidential Election and Related Matters, May 17, 2017) (“Appointment Order”).  \\nRelying on “the authority vested” in the Acting Attorney General, “including 28 U.S.C. §§ 509, \\n510, and 515,” the Acting Attorney General ordered the appointment of a Special Counsel “in \\norder  to  discharge  [the  Acting  Attorney  General’s]  responsibility  to  provide  supervision  and \\nmanagement of the Department of Justice, and to ensure a full and thorough investigation of the \\nRussian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.”  Appointment Order \\n(introduction). “The Special Counsel,” the Order stated, “is authorized to conduct the investigation \\nconfirmed by then-FBI Director James B. Comey in testimony before the House Permanent Select \\nCommittee on Intelligence on March 20, 2017,” including: \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(i) any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals \\n\\nassociated with the campaign of President Donald Trump; and \\n\\n \\n(ii) any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation; and \\n \\n(iii) any other matters within the scope of 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a). \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nAppointment Order ¶ (b).  Section 600.4 affords the Special Counsel “the authority to investigate \\nand prosecute federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the \\n \\nSpecial Counsel’s investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, \\nand intimidation of witnesses.”  28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a).  The authority to investigate “any matters \\nthat arose . . . directly from the investigation,” Appointment Order ¶ (b)(ii), covers similar crimes \\nthat may have occurred during the course of the FBI’s confirmed investigation before the Special \\nCounsel’s appointment.  “If the Special Counsel believes it is necessary and appropriate,” the \\n \\nOrder further provided, “the Special Counsel is authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from \\nthe investigation of these matters.”  Id. ¶ (c).  Finally, the Acting Attorney General made applicable \\n“Sections 600.4 through 600.10 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations.”  Id. ¶ (d). \\n\\n \\nThe  Acting  Attorney  General  further  clarified  the  scope  of  the  Special  Counsel’s \\ninvestigatory authority in two subsequent memoranda.  A memorandum dated August 2, 2017, \\nexplained that the Appointment Order had been “worded categorically in order to permit its public \\n \\nrelease  without  confirming  specific  investigations  involving  specific  individuals.” \\nIt  then \\n \\nconfirmed  that  the  Special  Counsel  had  been  authorized  since  his  appointment  to  investigate \\n \\nallegations  that  three  Trump  campaign  officials—Carter  Page,  Paul  Manafort,  and  George \\n \\nPapadopoulos—“committed a crime or crimes by colluding with Russian government officials \\n \\nwith respect to the Russian government’s efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.”  \\nThe  memorandum  also  confirmed  the  Special  Counsel’s  authority  to  investigate  certain  other \\nmatters,  including  two  additional  sets  of  allegations  involving  Manafort  (crimes  arising  from \\npayments he received from the Ukrainian government and crimes arising from his receipt of loans \\n \\n\\n   \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n11 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

First, “as part of a \\nfull  and  thorough  investigation  of  the  Russian  government’s  efforts  to  interfere  in  the  2016 \\npresidential election,” the Special Counsel was authorized to investigate “the pertinent activities \\nof Michael Cohen, Richard Gates,  \\n \\n”    “Confirmation  of  the  authorization  to  investigate  such  individuals,”  the  memorandum \\nstressed, “does not suggest that the Special Counsel has made a  determination that  any  of  them  has \\ncommitted a crime.”  Second, with respect to Michael Cohen,  the  memorandum  recognized the \\nSpecial Counsel’s authority to investigate “leads relate[d] to Cohen’s establishment and use of \\nEssential Consultants LLC to, inter alia, receive funds from  Russian-backed entities.”  Third, the \\nmemorandum  memorialized the Special Counsel’s authority to investigate individuals and entities \\nwho  were  possibly  engaged  in  “jointly  undertaken  activity”  with   existing  subjects  of  the \\ninvestigation, including Paul Manafort.  Finally, the memorandum  described an FBI investigation  \\nopened before the Special Counsel’s appointment into “allegations that [then-Attorney General  \\nJeff Sessions] made false statements to the United States Senate[,]” and confirmed the Special  \\nCounsel’s authority to investigate that matter.    \\n\\n, Roger Stone, and\\n\\nPP \\n\\n \\nThe Special Counsel structured the investigation in view of his power and authority “to \\nexercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions of any United States Attorney.”  28 C.F.R. \\n§ 600.6.  Like  a  U.S.  Attorney’s  Office,  the  Special  Counsel’s  Office  considered  a  range  of \\n \\nclassified and unclassified information available to the FBI in the course of the Office’s Russia \\ninvestigation, and the Office structured that work around evidence for possible use in prosecutions \\nof federal crimes (assuming that one or more crimes were identified that warranted prosecution).  \\nThere was substantial evidence immediately available to the Special Counsel at the inception of \\nthe investigation in May 2017 because the FBI had, by that time, already investigated Russian \\nelection interference for nearly 10 months.  The Special Counsel’s Office exercised its judgment \\nregarding what to investigate and did not, for instance, investigate every public report of a contact \\nbetween the Trump Campaign and Russian-affiliated individuals and entities.      \\n\\n \\nThe Office has concluded its investigation into links and coordination between the Russian \\n \\ngovernment and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign.  Certain proceedings associated \\nwith the Office’s work remain ongoing.  After consultation with the Office of the Deputy Attorney \\nGeneral, the Office has transferred responsibility for those remaining issues to other components \\nof the Department of Justice and FBI.  Appendix D lists those transfers.   \\n\\n \\nTwo district courts confirmed the breadth of the Special Counsel’s authority to investigate \\nRussia election interference and links and/or coordination with the Trump Campaign.  See United \\nStates v. Manafort, 312 F. Supp. 3d 60, 79-83 (D.D.C. 2018); United States v. Manafort, 321 F. \\n \\nSupp. 3d 640, 650-655 (E.D. Va. 2018).  In the course of conducting that investigation, the Office \\nperiodically identified evidence of potential criminal activity that was outside the scope of the \\nSpecial Counsel’s authority established by the Acting Attorney General.  After consultation with \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n12 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

These  attorneys  were  assisted  by  a  filter  team  of  Department  lawyers  and  FBI \\npersonnel who screened materials obtained via court process for privileged information before \\nturning those materials over to investigators; a support staff of three paralegals on detail from the \\nDepartment’s  Antitrust  Division;  and  an  administrative  staff  of  nine  responsible  for  budget, \\nfinance, purchasing, human resources, records, facilities, security, information technology, and \\nadministrative support.  The Special Counsel attorneys and support staff were co-located with and \\nworked  alongside  approximately  40  FBI  agents,  intelligence  analysts,  forensic  accountants,  a \\nparalegal, and professional staff assigned by the FBI to assist the Special Counsel’s investigation.  \\nThose “assigned” FBI employees remained under FBI supervision at all times; the matters on \\nwhich they assisted were supervised by the Special Counsel.1 \\n \\n\\n \\nDuring its investigation the Office issued more than 2,800 subpoenas under the auspices of \\na grand jury sitting in the District of Columbia; executed nearly 500 search-and-seizure warrants; \\nobtained more than 230 orders for communications records under 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d); obtained \\n \\nalmost  50  orders  authorizing  use  of  pen  registers;  made  13  requests  to  foreign  governments \\npursuant  to  Mutual  Legal  Assistance  Treaties;  and  interviewed  approximately  500  witnesses, \\nincluding almost 80 before a grand jury. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n* * * \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nFrom  its  inception,  the  Office  recognized  that  its  investigation  could  identify  foreign \\nintelligence and counterintelligence information relevant to the FBI’s broader national security \\nmission.  FBI personnel who assisted the Office established procedures to identify and convey \\nsuch information to the FBI.  The FBI’s Counterintelligence Division met with the Office regularly \\n \\nfor  that  purpose  for  most  of  the  Office’s  tenure.  For  more  than  the  past  year,  the  FBI  also \\n \\nembedded personnel at the Office who did not work on the Special Counsel’s investigation, but \\nwhose purpose was to review the results of the investigation and to send—in writing—summaries \\nof  foreign  intelligence  and  counterintelligence  information  to  FBIHQ  and  FBI  Field  Offices. \\n \\nThose  communications  and  other  correspondence  between  the  Office  and  the  FBI  contain \\n \\ninformation derived from the investigation, not all of which is contained in this Volume.  This \\nVolume is a summary.  It contains, in the Office’s judgment, that information necessary to account \\n \\nfor the Special Counsel’s prosecution and declination decisions and to describe the investigation’s \\nmain factual results.     \\n                                                 \\n\\n1 FBI personnel assigned to the Special Counsel’s Office were required to adhere to all applicable \\n \\nfederal law and all Department and FBI regulations, guidelines, and policies.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c  \\n\\nII.  RUSSIAN “ACTIVE MEASURES” SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN \\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe first form of Russian election influence came principally from the Internet Research \\nAgency,  LLC  (IRA),  a  Russian  organization  funded  by  Yevgeniy  Viktorovich  Prigozhin  and \\ncompanies  he  controlled,  including  Concord  Management  and  Consulting  LLC  and  Concord \\nCatering (collectively “Concord”).2  The IRA conducted social media operations targeted at large \\nU.S. audiences with the goal of sowing discord in the U.S. political system.3  These operations \\nconstituted “active measures” (активные мероприятия), a term that typically refers to operations \\nconducted by Russian security services aimed at influencing the course of international affairs.4 \\n      \\n\\n \\nThe IRA and its employees began operations targeting the United States as early as 2014.  \\nUsing fictitious U.S. personas, IRA employees operated social media accounts and group pages \\ndesigned to attract U.S. audiences.  These groups and accounts, which addressed divisive U.S. \\npolitical and social issues, falsely claimed to be controlled by U.S. activists.  Over time, these \\nsocial media accounts became a means to reach large U.S. audiences.  IRA employees travelled to \\nthe  United  States  in  mid-2014  on  an  intelligence-gathering  mission  to  obtain  information  and \\nphotographs for use in their social media posts.  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIRA employees posted derogatory information about a number of candidates in the 2016 \\nU.S. presidential election.  By early to mid-2016, IRA operations included supporting the Trump \\n \\nCampaign and disparaging candidate Hillary Clinton.  The IRA made various expenditures to carry \\nout those activities, including buying political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. \\npersons and entities.  Some IRA employees, posing as U.S. persons and without revealing their \\n \\nRussian  association,  communicated  electronically  with  individuals  associated  with  the  Trump \\n \\nCampaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities, including the \\nstaging of political rallies.5  The investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons \\nknowingly or intentionally coordinated with the IRA’s interference operation.  \\n\\n \\nBy the end of the 2016 U.S. election, the IRA had the ability to reach millions of U.S. \\npersons  through  their  social  media  accounts.  Multiple  IRA-controlled  Facebook  groups  and \\n                                                 \\n\\n2  The Office is aware of reports that other Russian entities engaged in similar active measures \\n \\n \\noperations targeting the United States.  Some evidence collected by the Office corroborates those reports, \\nand the Office has shared that evidence with other offices in the Department of Justice and FBI.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n3 \\n \\n\\n \\nsee also  SM-2230634, serial 44 (analysis). The FBI case number cited here, and other FBI case numbers  \\nidentified in the report, should be treated as law enforcement sensitive given the context. The report contains  \\nadditional law enforcement sensitive information.  \\n\\n4  As discussed in Part V  below, the active measures investigation has resulted in criminal charges \\nagainst 13 individual Russian nationals and three Russian entities, principally for  conspiracy  to defraud the \\nUnited States, in violation  of  18 U.S.C. §  371.

Pro-Trump  rallies included three in New \\nYork; a series of pro-Trump rallies in Florida in August 2016; and a \\nseries of pro-Trump rallies in October 2016 in Pennsylvania.  The \\n \\nFlorida rallies drew the attention of the Trump Campaign, which \\nposted  about  the  Miami  rally  on  candidate  Trump’s  Facebook \\naccount (as discussed below).86\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMany of the same IRA employees who oversaw the IRA’s \\n \\nsocial media accounts also conducted the day-to-day recruiting for \\n \\npolitical  rallies  inside  the  United  States. \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n87\\n\\n   \\n\\nIRA Poster for Pennsylvania \\nRallies organized by the IRA \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n6. Targeting and Recruitment of U.S. Persons\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nAs early as 2014, the IRA instructed its employees to  target U.S. persons who could be  \\nused to advance its operational goals.

The IRA recruited U.S. \\n \\npersons from  across the political spectrum.   For example, the IRA targeted the family of  \\n and a  number  of  black social justice  activists \\n\\n \\n\\n                                                 \\n\\n86 The pro-Trump rallies were organized through multiple Facebook, Twitter, and email accounts.  \\n \\nSee,  e.g.,  Facebook  ID  100009922908461  (Matt  Skiber);  Facebook  ID  1601685693432389  (Being \\n \\nPatriotic); Twitter Account @march_for_trump; beingpatriotic@gmail.com.

Contact with Trump Campaign Officials in Connection to Rallies \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nStarting in June 2016, the IRA contacted different U.S. persons affiliated with the Trump \\nCampaign in an effort to coordinate pro-Trump IRA-organized rallies inside the United States.  In \\nall cases, the IRA contacted the Campaign while claiming to be U.S. political activists working on \\n \\nbehalf of a conservative grassroots organization.  The IRA’s contacts included requests for signs \\n \\nand other materials to use at rallies,107 as well as requests to promote the rallies and help coordinate \\nlogistics.108  While  certain  campaign  volunteers  agreed  to  provide  the  requested  support  (for \\n \\nexample, agreeing to set aside a number of signs), the investigation has not identified evidence \\nthat any Trump Campaign official understood the requests were coming from foreign nationals.  \\n \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n* * * \\n\\nIn sum, the investigation established that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election \\nthrough the “active measures” social media campaign carried out by the IRA, an organization \\nfunded by Prigozhin and companies that he controlled.  As explained further in Volume I, Section \\nV.A, infra, the Office concluded (and a grand jury has alleged) that Prigozhin, his companies, and \\nIRA employees violated U.S. law through these operations, principally by undermining through \\ndeceptive  acts  the  work  of  federal  agencies  charged  with regulating  foreign  influence  in  U.S. \\nelections. \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n   \\n106 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n                                                 \\n\\n106 \\n \\n\\nTrump/Pence \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n107  See, e.g., 8/16/16 Email, joshmilton024@gmail.com to \\n\\n@donaldtrump.com (asking for \\n \\nto \\njoshmilton024@gmail.com \\n@donaldtrump.com  (asking  for  Trump/Pence  signs  for  Florida  rally);  8/12/16  Email, \\n \\n@donaldtrump.com (asking for “contact phone numbers for Trump \\n\\n8/18/16  Email, \\n\\nfor \\n \\n \\n\\nFlorida \\n\\nrally); \\n\\nsigns \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\njoshmilton024@gmail.com to \\nCampaign affiliates” in various Florida cities and signs). \\n\\n108  8/15/16 Email, \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nlocations  to  the  “Florida  Goes  Trump,”  list);  8/16/16  Email, \\njoshmilton024@gmail.com (volunteering to send an email blast to followers). \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nto joshmilton024@gmail.com (asking to add to \\n \\nto \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n35 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

RUSSIAN HACKING AND DUMPING OPERATIONS \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nBeginning in March 2016, units of the Russian Federation’s Main Intelligence Directorate \\nof the General Staff (GRU) hacked the computers and email accounts of organizations, employees, \\nand  volunteers  supporting  the  Clinton  Campaign,  including  the  email  account  of  campaign \\nchairman John Podesta. Starting in April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the \\nDemocratic  Congressional  Campaign  Committee  (DCCC)  and  the  Democratic  National \\nCommittee (DNC).  The GRU targeted hundreds of email accounts used by Clinton Campaign \\nemployees, advisors, and volunteers.  In total, the GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents \\nfrom the compromised email accounts and networks.109  The GRU later released stolen Clinton \\n \\n \\nCampaign and DNC documents through online personas, “DCLeaks” and “Guccifer 2.0,” and later \\nthrough the organization WikiLeaks.  The release of the documents was designed and timed to \\ninterfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election and undermine the Clinton Campaign.  \\n\\nfall  of  2016, \\n\\n \\nThe Trump Campaign showed interest in the WikiLeaks releases and, in the summer and \\n \\n  After  \\n, the Trump Campaign \\nabout WikiLeaks’s activities.  The investigation was unable to resolve \\n \\nWikiLeaks’s release of the stolen Podesta emails on October 7, \\n2016, the same  day a  video from  years earlier was published of Trump using graphic language \\nabout women.    \\n\\n WikiLeaks’s first Clinton-related release  \\n \\n\\nstayed in contact \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nA.

By stealing  network  access \\ncredentials along the way (including those of IT administrators with unrestricted access to the \\n   \\nsystem), the GRU compromised approximately 29 different computers on the DCCC network.119 \\n\\n \\nApproximately six days after first hacking into the DCCC network, on April 18, 2016, \\n \\nGRU officers gained access to the DNC network via a virtual private network (VPN) connection120 \\nbetween the DCCC and DNC networks.121  Between April 18, 2016 and June 8, 2016, Unit 26165 \\ncompromised more than 30 computers on the DNC network, including the DNC mail server and \\n  \\nshared file server.122 \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nb.  Implantation of Malware on DCCC and DNC Networks \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nUnit  26165  implanted  on  the  DCCC  and  DNC  networks  two  types  of  customized \\nmalware,123  known as “X-Agent” and “X-Tunnel”; Mimikatz, a credential-harvesting tool; and \\n \\nrar.exe, a tool used in these intrusions to compile and compress materials for exfiltration.  X-Agent \\nwas a multi-function hacking tool that allowed Unit 26165 to log keystrokes, take screenshots, and \\ngather other data about the infected computers (e.g., file directories, operating systems).124  X-\\n \\nTunnel was a hacking tool that created an encrypted connection between the victim DCCC/DNC \\ncomputers and GRU-controlled computers outside the DCCC and DNC networks that was capable \\nof large-scale data transfers.125 GRU officers then used X-Tunnel to exfiltrate stolen data from the \\nvictim computers. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n2.

Therefore, while the DCCC employees were outside the DNC’s \\n \\nprivate network, they could access parts of the DNC network from their DCCC computers. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n121 \\n \\n\\n122 \\n \\n\\nInvestigative Technique\\n\\nM-2589105-HACK, serial 5. \\n\\n \\nSM-2589105-HACK, serial 5.\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n123 “Malware” is short for malicious software, and here refers to software designed to allow a third \\n\\n \\nparty to infiltrate a computer without the consent or knowledge of the computer’s user or operator.   \\n\\n \\n\\n124 \\n \\n125 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n38 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

Dissemination of the Hacked Materials \\n \\nThe  GRU’s  operations  extended  beyond  stealing  materials,  and  included  releasing \\n \\ndocuments  stolen  from  the  Clinton  Campaign  and  its  supporters.    The  GRU  carried  out  the \\n \\nanonymous release through two fictitious online personas that it created—DCLeaks and Guccifer \\n2.0—and later through the organization WikiLeaks.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1.

Other \\n \\ndcleaks.com pages contained indexes of the stolen emails that were being released (bearing the \\n \\nsender, recipient, and date of the email).  To control access and the timing of releases, pages were \\nsometimes password-protected for a period of time and later made unrestricted to the public.   \\n\\n \\n \\nStarting in June 2016, the GRU posted stolen documents onto the website dcleaks.com, \\nincluding documents stolen from a number of individuals associated with the Clinton Campaign.  \\nThese documents appeared to have originated from personal email accounts (in particular, Google \\n \\nand Microsoft accounts), rather than the DNC and DCCC computer networks.  DCLeaks victims \\nincluded an advisor to the Clinton Campaign, a former DNC employee and Clinton Campaign \\n \\nemployee,  and  four  other  campaign  volunteers.139  The  GRU  released  through  dcleaks.com \\nthousands  of  documents,  including  personal  identifying  and  financial  information,  internal \\ncorrespondence related to the Clinton Campaign and prior political jobs, and fundraising files and \\n \\ninformation.140 \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                                 \\n\\n \\n\\n136 Netyksho Indictment ¶ 29.

In the hours leading up \\nto the launch of that WordPress blog, GRU officers logged into a Moscow-based server used and \\nmanaged by Unit 74455 and searched for a number of specific words and phrases in English, \\nincluding  “some  hundred  sheets,”  “illuminati,”  and  “worldwide  known.”  Approximately  two \\n \\nhours after the last of those searches, Guccifer 2.0 published its first post, attributing the DNC \\nserver hack to a lone Romanian hacker and using several of the unique English words and phrases \\n   \\nthat the GRU officers had searched for that day.146 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                                 \\nTennessee-based web-hosting company, called Smartech Corporation.

WikiLeaks’s First Contact with Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\nShortly after the GRU’s first release of stolen documents through dcleaks.com in June \\n2016,  GRU  officers  also  used  the  DCLeaks  persona  to  contact  WikiLeaks  about  possible \\ncoordination in the future release of stolen emails.  On June 14, 2016, @dcleaks_ sent a direct \\nmessage to @WikiLeaks, noting, “You announced your organization was preparing to publish \\nmore Hillary’s emails. We are ready to support you. We have some sensitive information too, in \\nparticular, her financial documents. Let’s do it together. What  do you think about publishing our \\n \\n   \\ninfo  at  the  same  moment?  Thank  you.”159 \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nAround  the  same  time,  WikiLeaks  initiated  communications  with  the  GRU  persona \\nGuccifer 2.0 shortly after it was used to release documents stolen from the DNC.  On June 22, \\n2016, seven days after Guccifer 2.0’s first releases of stolen DNC documents, WikiLeaks used \\nTwitter’s direct message function to contact the Guccifer 2.0 Twitter account and suggest that \\nGuccifer 2.0 “[s]end any new material [stolen from the DNC] here for us to review and it will have \\n   \\na much higher impact than what you are doing.”160 \\n\\n \\n \\nOn  July  6,  2016,  WikiLeaks  again  contacted  Guccifer  2.0  through  Twitter’s  private \\nmessaging function, writing, “if you have anything hillary related we want it in the next tweo [sic] \\ndays prefable [sic] because the DNC is approaching and she will solidify bernie supporters behind \\nher after.”  The Guccifer 2.0 persona responded, “ok . . . i see.”  WikiLeaks also explained, “we \\nthink trump has only a 25% chance of winning against hillary . . . so conflict between bernie and \\n \\nhillary is interesting.”161 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nc.

WikiLeaks Statements Dissembling About the Source of Stolen Materials \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nAs reports attributing the DNC and DCCC hacks to the Russian government emerged, \\nWikiLeaks and Assange made several public statements apparently designed to obscure the source \\nof the materials that WikiLeaks was releasing.  The file-transfer evidence described above and \\n \\nother  information  uncovered  during  the  investigation  discredit  WikiLeaks’s  claims  about  the \\nsource of material that it posted.  \\n\\n \\nBeginning in the summer of 2016, Assange and WikiLeaks made a number of statements \\nabout Seth Rich, a former DNC staff member who was killed in July 2016.  The statements about \\nRich implied falsely that he had been the source of the stolen DNC emails.  On August 9, 2016, \\nthe  @WikiLeaks  Twitter  account  posted:  “ANNOUNCE:  WikiLeaks  has  decided  to  issue  a \\n  \\nUS$20k reward for information leading to conviction for the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich.”180 \\nLikewise, on August 25, 2016, Assange was asked in an interview, “Why are you so interested in \\nSeth Rich’s killer?” and responded, “We’re very interested in anything that might be a threat to \\nalleged Wikileaks sources.”  The interviewer responded to Assange’s statement by commenting, \\n“I know you don’t want to reveal your source, but it certainly sounds like you’re suggesting a man \\nwho leaked information to WikiLeaks was then murdered.”  Assange replied, “If there’s someone \\n \\nwho’s potentially connected to our publication, and that person has been murdered in suspicious \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                                 \\n\\n176 \\n \\n\\n177 \\n \\n\\nPersonal Privacy\\n\\n  \\n\\n178 \\n\\nPersonal Privacy\\n\\n \\n\\n179 Netyksho Indictment ¶ 43.  \\n180 @WikiLeaks 8/9/16 Tweet. \\n\\n \\n\\n48 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

But it is a very serious \\n \\nmatter…that type of allegation is very serious, as it’s taken very seriously by us.”181 \\n \\n\\n \\nAfter the U.S. intelligence community publicly announced its assessment that Russia was \\nbehind the hacking operation, Assange continued to deny that the Clinton materials released by \\n \\nWikiLeaks had come from Russian hacking.  According to media reports, Assange told a U.S. \\ncongressman that the DNC hack was an “inside job,” and purported to have “physical proof” that \\nRussians did not give materials to Assange.182 \\n\\n \\nC.  Additional GRU Cyber Operations \\n \\nWhile  releasing  the  stolen  emails  and  documents  through  DCLeaks,  Guccifer  2.0,  and \\nWikiLeaks, GRU officers continued to target and hack victims linked to the Democratic campaign \\nand, eventually, to target entities responsible for election administration in several states.     \\n\\n      \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n1.  Summer and Fall 2016 Operations Targeting Democrat-Linked Victims \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n \\nOn July 27, 2016, Unit 26165 targeted email accounts connected to candidate Clinton’s \\n  \\n \\n.  Earlier that day, candidate Trump made public statements that \\npersonal office \\n \\nincluded the following: “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails \\nthat are missing.  I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.”183  The “30,000 \\nemails” were apparently a reference to emails described in media accounts as having been stored \\non a personal server that candidate Clinton had used while serving as Secretary of State.   \\n\\n \\nWithin approximately five hours of Trump’s statement, GRU officers targeted for the first \\ntime Clinton’s personal office.  After candidate Trump’s remarks, Unit 26165 created and sent \\nmalicious  links  targeting  15  email  accounts  at  the  domain \\nincluding  an  email \\n  \\naccount belonging to Clinton aide \\nThe investigation did not find evidence of earlier \\n \\n \\nGRU attempts to compromise accounts hosted on this domain.

Victims included \\n \\nU.S. state and local entities, such as state boards of elections (SBOEs), secretaries of state, and \\n \\ncounty  governments,  as  well  as  individuals  who  worked  for  those  entities.186    The  GRU  also \\n \\ntargeted private technology firms responsible for manufacturing and administering election-related \\n \\nsoftware and hardware, such as voter registration software and electronic polling stations.187  The \\nGRU  continued  to  target  these  victims  through  the  elections  in  November  2016.  While  the \\ninvestigation identified evidence that the GRU targeted these individuals and entities, the Office \\ndid not investigate further.  The Office did not, for instance, obtain or examine servers or other \\nrelevant  items  belonging  to  these  victims.  The  Office  understands  that  the  FBI,  the  U.S. \\n \\nDepartment of Homeland Security, and the states have separately investigated that activity. \\n \\n\\n \\nBy at least the summer of 2016, GRU officers sought access to state and local computer \\nnetworks by exploiting known software vulnerabilities on websites of state and local governmental \\nentities.  GRU officers, for example, targeted state and local databases of registered voters using a \\ntechnique  known  as  “SQL  injection,”  by  which  malicious  code  was  sent  to  the  state  or  local \\nwebsite in order to run commands (such as exfiltrating the database contents).188  In one instance \\n \\nin approximately June 2016, the GRU compromised the computer network of the Illinois State \\nBoard of Elections by exploiting a vulnerability in the SBOE’s website.  The GRU then gained \\naccess  to  a  database  containing  information  on  millions  of  registered  Illinois  voters,189  and \\n   \\nextracted data related to thousands of U.S. voters before the malicious activity was identified.190 \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nGRU  officers \\n\\nvulnerabilities.

In August 2016, GRU \\nofficers targeted employees of \\n, a voting technology company that developed software \\nused by numerous U.S. counties to manage voter rolls, and installed malware on the company \\nnetwork. Similarly, in November 2016, the GRU sent spearphishing emails to over 120 email \\naccounts used by Florida county officials responsible for administering the 2016 U.S. election.191 \\n  \\n \\nThe spearphishing emails contained an attached Word document coded with malicious software \\n  \\n(commonly referred to as a Trojan) that permitted the GRU to access the infected computer.192 \\nThe FBI was separately responsible for this investigation.

Some of these contacts were met with \\nskepticism, and nothing came of them; others were pursued to some degree.  The investigation did \\nnot  find  evidence  that  the  Trump  Campaign  recovered  any  such  Clinton  emails,  or  that  these \\ncontacts were part of a coordinated effort between Russia and the Trump Campaign. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\na.

At the meeting, Rasin offered to sell Stone derogatory information \\non  Clinton that  Rasin claimed  to  have  obtained  while  working  for  Clinton.  Rasin claimed  to \\npossess  financial  statements  demonstrating  Clinton’s  involvement  in  money  laundering  with \\nRasin’s  companies.  According to  Oknyansky,  Stone  asked  if  the amounts  in  question totaled \\nmillions of dollars but was told it was closer to hundreds of thousands.  Stone refused the offer, \\n   \\nstating that Trump would not pay for opposition research.261 \\n \\n\\n \\nOknyansky  claimed  to the  Office  that  Rasin’s motivation was  financial.  According  to \\nOknyansky,  Rasin  had  tried  unsuccessfully  to  shop  the  Clinton  information  around  to  other \\n \\ninterested parties, and Oknyansky would receive a cut if the information was sold.262  Rasin is \\nnoted in public source documents as the director and/or registered agent for a number of Florida \\n \\ncompanies, none of which appears to be connected to Clinton.  The Office found no other evidence \\n \\nthat Rasin worked for Clinton or any Clinton-related entities. \\n \\n\\nIn their statements to investigators, Oknyansky and Caputo had contradictory recollections \\nabout  the  meeting.  Oknyansky  claimed  that  Caputo  accompanied  Stone  to  the  meeting  and \\nprovided an introduction, whereas Caputo did not tell us that he had attended and claimed that he \\n \\nwas never told what information Oknyansky offered.  Caputo also stated that he was unaware \\n   \\nOknyansky sought to be paid for the information until Stone informed him after the fact.263 \\n                                                 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n260 Caputo 5/2/18 302, at 4; Oknyansky 7/13/18 302, at 1.  \\n261 Oknyansky 7/13/18 302, at 1-2. \\n \\n262 Oknyansky 7/13/18 302, at 2. \\n \\n263 Caputo 5/2/18 302, at 4; Oknyansky 7/13/18 302, at 1. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n61 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

Campaign Efforts to Obtain Deleted Clinton Emails \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\nAfter  candidate  Trump  stated  on  July  27,  2016,  that  he  hoped  Russia  would  “find  the \\n30,000 emails that are missing,” Trump asked individuals affiliated with his Campaign to find the \\n \\ndeleted Clinton emails.264  Michael Flynn—who would later serve as National Security Advisor in \\nthe  Trump  Administration—recalled  that  Trump  made  this  request  repeatedly,  and  Flynn \\n  \\nsubsequently contacted multiple people in an effort to obtain the emails.265 \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\nBarbara Ledeen and Peter Smith were among the people contacted by Flynn.  Ledeen, a \\nlong-time Senate staffer who had previously sought the Clinton emails, provided updates to Flynn \\nabout her efforts throughout the summer of 2016.266  Smith, an investment advisor who was active \\n \\nin Republican politics, also attempted to locate and obtain the deleted Clinton emails.267 \\n \\n\\n \\nLedeen began her efforts to obtain the Clinton emails before Flynn’s request, as early as \\nDecember 2015.268  On December 3, 2015, she emailed Smith a proposal to obtain the emails, \\n \\nstating,  “Here is the proposal I briefly mentioned to you. The person I described to you would be \\nhappy to talk with you either in person or over the phone.  The person can get the emails which 1. \\nWere classified and 2. Were purloined by our enemies.  That would demonstrate what needs to be \\n  \\ndemonstrated.”269 \\n\\n \\n \\nAttached to the email was a 25-page proposal stating that the “Clinton email server was, in \\nall likelihood, breached long ago,” and that the Chinese, Russian, and Iranian intelligence services \\ncould “re-assemble the server’s email content.”270  The proposal called for a three-phase approach.  \\nThe first two phases consisted of open-source analysis.  The third phase consisted of checking with \\n \\ncertain intelligence sources “that have access through liaison work with various foreign services” \\n \\nto determine if any of those services had gotten to the server.   The proposal noted, “Even if a \\nsingle email was recovered and the providence [sic] of that email was a foreign service, it would \\n \\nbe catastrophic to the Clinton campaign[.]”  Smith forwarded the email to two colleagues and \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                                 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n264 Flynn 4/25/18 302, at 5-6; Flynn 5/1/18 302, at 1-3. \\n \\n265 Flynn 5/1/18 302, at 1-3. \\n \\n266 Flynn 4/25/18 302, at 7; Flynn 5/4/18 302, at 1-2; Flynn 11/29/17 302, at 7-8. \\n \\n267 Flynn 11/29/17 302, at 7. \\n \\n268 Szobocsan 3/29/17 302, at 1. \\n269 12/3/15 Email, Ledeen to Smith.  \\n  \\n270 12/3/15 Email, Ledeen to Smith (attachment). \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n62 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

He created a company, raised tens of thousands of \\n \\ndollars,  and  recruited  security  experts  and  business  associates.  Smith  made  claims  to  others \\n \\ninvolved in the effort (and those from whom he sought funding) that he was in contact with hackers \\n \\nwith  “ties  and  affiliations  to  Russia”  who  had  access  to  the  emails,  and  that  his  efforts  were \\n  \\ncoordinated with the Trump Campaign.273 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nOn August 28, 2016, Smith sent an email from an encrypted account with the subject “Sec. \\nClinton’s unsecured private email server” to an undisclosed list of recipients, including Campaign \\n \\nco-chairman Sam Clovis.  The email stated that Smith was “[j]ust finishing two days of sensitive \\nmeetings here in DC with involved groups to poke and probe on the above.  It is clear that the \\nClinton’s home-based, unprotected server was hacked with ease by both State-related players, and \\n \\nprivate mercenaries. Parties with varying interests, are circling to release ahead of the election.”274 \\n\\n \\nOn September 2, 2016, Smith directed a business associate to establish KLS Research LLC \\nin furtherance of his search for the deleted Clinton emails.275  One of the purposes of KLS Research \\nwas to manage the funds Smith raised in support of his initiative.276  KLS Research received over \\n$30,000 during the presidential campaign, although Smith represented that he raised even more \\n   \\nmoney.277 \\n\\n \\nSmith recruited multiple people for his initiative, including security experts to search for \\nand authenticate the emails.278  In early September 2016, as part of his recruitment and fundraising \\neffort, Smith circulated a document stating that his initiative was “in coordination” with the Trump \\nCampaign, “to the extent permitted as an independent expenditure organization.”279  The document \\nlisted multiple individuals affiliated with the Trump Campaign, including Flynn, Clovis, Bannon, \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                                 \\n\\n271 12/3/15 Email, Smith to Szobocsan & Safron.  \\n272 Szobocsan 3/29/18 302, at 1. \\n273 8/31/16 Email, Smith to Smith. \\n274 8/28/16 Email, Smith to Smith.  \\n275 Incorporation papers of KLS Research LLC, 7/26/17 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSzobocsan 3/29/18 302, at 2. \\n\\n276 Szobocsan 3/29/18 302, at 3. \\n277  Financial  Institution  Record  of  Peter  Smith  and  KLS  Research  LLC,  10/31/17 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n10/11/16 Email, Smith to \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n278 Tait 8/22/17 302, at 3; York 7/12/17 302, at 1-2; York 11/22/17 302, at 1. \\n \\n279 York 7/13/17 302 (attachment KLS Research, LLC, “Clinton Email Reconnaissance Initiative,” \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSept. 9, 2016). \\n\\n \\n\\n63 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

Ledeen wrote to Smith, “wondering if you had some more detailed reports or \\nmemos or other data you could share because we have come a long way in our efforts since we \\nlast visited. . . . We would need as much technical discussion as possible so we could marry it \\n \\nagainst the new data we have found and then could share it back to you ‘your eyes only.’”282 \\n\\n \\nLedeen claimed to have obtained a trove of emails (from what she described as the “dark \\n \\nweb”) that purported to be the deleted Clinton emails.  Ledeen wanted to authenticate the emails \\nand solicited contributions to fund that effort.  Erik Prince provided funding to hire a tech advisor \\n \\nto ascertain the authenticity of the emails.  According to Prince, the tech advisor determined that \\n   \\nthe emails were not authentic.283 \\n\\n \\n \\nA  backup  of  Smith’s  computer  contained  two  files  that  had  been  downloaded  from \\nWikiLeaks and that were originally attached to emails received by John Podesta.  The files on \\nSmith’s computer had creation dates of October 2, 2016, which was prior to the date of their release \\nby WikiLeaks.  Forensic examination, however, established that the creation date did not reflect \\nwhen the files were downloaded to Smith’s computer.  (It appears the creation date was when \\nWikiLeaks staged the document for release, as discussed in Volume I, Section III.B.3.c, supra.284) \\nThe investigation did not otherwise identify evidence that Smith obtained the files before their \\nrelease by WikiLeaks. \\n\\n \\nSmith continued to send emails to an undisclosed recipient list about Clinton’s deleted \\nemails until shortly before the election.  For example, on October 28, 2016, Smith wrote that there \\nwas a “tug-of-war going on within WikiLeaks over its planned releases in the next few days,” and \\nthat WikiLeaks “has maintained that it will save its best revelations for last, under the theory this \\n \\nallows little time for response prior to the U.S. election November 8.”285  An attachment to the \\n                                                 \\n\\nsame \\n\\n280  The \\n\\nrecruitment \\n\\n“Independent \\nGroups/Organizations/Individuals,” and described him as an “established author and writer from the right \\non President Obama and Sec.

For example, in one such email, Smith claimed that, in August 2016, KLS Research had \\norganized meetings with parties who had access to the deleted Clinton emails, including parties \\nwith “ties and affiliations to Russia.”286 The investigation did not identify evidence that any such \\n \\nmeetings occurred.

RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT LINKS TO AND CONTACTS WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe Office identified multiple contacts—“links,” in the words of the Appointment Order— \\nbetween Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government.  The \\n \\nOffice  investigated  whether  those  contacts  constituted  a  third  avenue  of  attempted  Russian \\ninterference with or influence on the 2016 presidential election.  In particular, the investigation \\n \\nexamined whether these contacts involved or resulted in coordination or a conspiracy with the \\nTrump  Campaign  and  Russia,  including  with  respect  to  Russia  providing  assistance  to  the \\nCampaign in exchange for any sort of favorable treatment in the future.  Based on the available \\ninformation, the investigation did not establish such coordination.      \\n \\n\\nThis Section describes the principal links between the Trump Campaign and individuals \\nwith ties to the Russian government, including some contacts with Campaign officials or associates \\nthat have been publicly reported to involve Russian contacts.  Each subsection begins with an \\noverview of the Russian contact at issue and then describes in detail the relevant facts, which are \\ngenerally presented in chronological order, beginning with the early months of the Campaign and \\nextending through the post-election, transition period.  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\nA.  Campaign Period (September 2015 – November 8, 2016) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nRussian-government-connected individuals and media entities began showing interest in \\n \\nTrump’s campaign in the months after he announced his candidacy in June 2015.288  Because \\n \\n \\nTrump’s status as a public figure at the time was attributable in large part to his prior business and \\nentertainment  dealings, this  Office  investigated  whether  a  business  contact  with Russia-linked \\n \\nindividuals  and  entities  during  the  campaign  period—the  Trump  Tower  Moscow  project,  see \\nVolume I, Section IV.A.1, infra—led to or involved coordination of election assistance.     \\n \\n\\nOutreach from individuals with ties to Russia continued in the spring and summer of 2016, \\nwhen  Trump  was  moving  toward—and  eventually  becoming—the  Republican  nominee  for \\nPresident.  As  set  forth  below,  the  Office  also  evaluated  a  series  of  links  during  this  period: \\noutreach  to  two  of  Trump’s  then-recently  named  foreign  policy  advisors,  including  a \\nrepresentation that Russia had “dirt” on Clinton in the form of thousands of emails (Volume I, \\n \\nSections IV.A.2 & IV.A.3); dealings with a D.C.-based think tank that specializes in Russia and \\n \\nhas  connections  with  its  government  (Volume  I,  Section  IV.A.4);  a  meeting  at  Trump  Tower \\nbetween the Campaign and a Russian lawyer promising dirt on candidate Clinton that was “part of \\n \\nRussia  and  its  government’s  support  for  [Trump]”  (Volume  I,  Section  IV.A.5);  events  at  the \\nRepublican National Convention (Volume I, Section IV.A.6); post-Convention contacts between \\n \\nTrump  Campaign  officials  and  Russia’s  ambassador  to  the  United  States  (Volume  I,  Section \\nIV.A.7); and contacts through campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who had previously worked for \\na Russian oligarch and a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine (Volume I, Section IV.A.8).    \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                                 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n288  For example, on August 18, 2015, on behalf of the editor-in-chief of the internet newspaper \\n \\nVzglyad, Georgi Asatryan emailed campaign press secretary Hope Hicks asking for a phone or in-person \\n \\n \\ncandidate interview.  8/18/15 Email, Asatryan to Hicks.

Some  projects  have  involved  the  acquisition  and  ownership \\n(through subsidiary corporate structures) of property.  In other cases, the Trump Organization has \\nexecuted licensing deals with real estate developers and management companies, often local to the \\ncountry where the project was located.289 \\n  \\n\\n \\nBetween at least 2013 and 2016, the Trump Organization explored a similar licensing deal \\nin  Russia  involving  the  construction  of  a  Trump-branded  property  in  Moscow.  The  project, \\n \\ncommonly referred to as a “Trump Tower Moscow” or “Trump Moscow” project, anticipated a \\ncombination  of  commercial,  hotel,  and  residential  properties  all  within  the  same  building. \\nBetween  2013  and  June  2016,  several  employees  of  the  Trump  Organization,  including  then-\\n \\npresident  of  the  organization  Donald  J.

In approximately September 2015, Felix Sater, a New York-\\nbased real estate advisor, contacted Michael Cohen, then-executive vice president of the Trump \\nOrganization and special counsel to Donald J. Trump.304  Sater had previously worked with the \\n \\n \\nTrump Organization and advised it on a number of domestic and international projects.  Sater had \\nexplored the possibility of a Trump Tower project in Moscow while working with the Trump \\n \\nOrganization  and  therefore  knew  of  the  organization’s  general  interest  in  completing  a  deal \\nthere.305    Sater  had  also  served  as  an  informal  agent  of  the  Trump  Organization  in  Moscow \\npreviously and had accompanied Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. to Moscow in the mid-\\n \\n2000s.306 \\n \\n \\nSater  contacted  Cohen  on  behalf  of  I.C.  Expert  Investment  Company  (I.C.  Expert),  a \\n \\nRussian real-estate development corporation controlled by Andrei Vladimirovich Rozov.307  Sater \\n \\nhad known Rozov since approximately 2007 and, in 2014, had served as an agent on behalf of \\nRozov during Rozov’s purchase of a building in New York City.308  Sater later contacted Rozov \\nand proposed that I.C. Expert pursue a Trump Tower Moscow project in which I.C. Expert would \\nlicense the name and brand from the Trump Organization but construct the building on its own. \\n   \\nSater worked on the deal with Rozov and another employee of I.C. Expert.309 \\n\\n \\nCohen  was  the  only  Trump  Organization  representative  to  negotiate  directly  with  I.C. \\nExpert or its agents.  In approximately September 2015, Cohen obtained approval to negotiate with \\n \\nI.C. Expert from candidate Trump, who was then president of the Trump Organization.  Cohen \\nprovided updates directly to Trump about the project throughout 2015 and into 2016, assuring him \\nthe  project  was  continuing.310  Cohen  also  discussed  the  Trump  Moscow  project  with  Ivanka \\nTrump as to design elements (such as possible architects to use for the project311) and Donald J. \\nTrump Jr. (about his experience in Moscow and possible involvement in the project312) during the \\nfall of 2015. \\n\\n   \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nagreement, \\n \\n\\n                                                 \\n\\n304   Sater provided information to our Office in two 2017 interviews conducted under a proffer  \\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n305 Grand Jury\\n306 Sater 9/19/17 302, at 1-2, 5. \\n \\n307 Sater 9/19/17 302, at 3. \\n \\n308 Rozov 1/25/18 302, at 1. \\n \\n309 Rozov 1/25/18 302, at 1; see also 11/2/15 Email, Cohen to Rozov et al.

Cohen also did not recall candidate Trump or \\nanyone affiliated with the Trump Campaign discussing the political implications of the Trump \\n \\nMoscow  project  with  him.  However,  Cohen  recalled  conversations  with  Trump  in  which  the \\ncandidate suggested that his campaign would be a significant “infomercial” for Trump-branded \\n  \\nproperties.329 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nii.  Post-LOI Contacts with Individuals in Russia \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n   \\n\\nGiven the size of the Trump Moscow project, Sater and Cohen believed the project required \\n \\napproval (whether express or implicit) from the Russian national government, including from the \\nPresidential  Administration  of  Russia.330  Sater  stated  that  he  therefore  began  to  contact  the \\n \\nPresidential Administration through another Russian business contact.331  In early negotiations \\n \\nwith  the  Trump  Organization,  Sater  had  alluded  to  the  need  for  government  approval  and  his \\nattempts to set up meetings with Russian officials.  On October 12, 2015, for example, Sater wrote \\nto Cohen that “all we need is Putin on board and we are golden,” and that a “meeting with Putin \\n \\n \\n  \\nthis meeting \\nand top deputy is tentatively set for the 14th [of October].”332 \\nwas being coordinated by associates in Russia and that he had no direct interaction with the Russian \\ngovernment.333 \\n\\n \\nApproximately a month later, after the LOI had been signed, Lana Erchova emailed Ivanka \\nTrump on behalf of Erchova’s then-husband Dmitry Klokov, to offer Klokov’s assistance to the \\nTrump Campaign.334  Klokov was at that time Director of External Communications for PJSC \\n \\nFederal  Grid  Company  of  Unified  Energy  System,  a  large  Russian  electricity  transmission \\n                                                 \\n\\n    \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n328 11/3/15 Email, Sater to Cohen (12:40 p.m.). \\n329 Cohen 9/12/18 302, at 3-4; Cohen 8/7/18 302, at 15. \\n \\n330\\n\\n \\n\\n Sater 12/15/17 302, at 2. \\n \\n\\n331 Sater 12/15/17 302, at 3-4. \\n332 10/12/15 Email, Sater to Cohen (8:07 a.m.).   \\n333 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n334 Ivanka Trump received an email from a woman who identified herself as “Lana E.

Ivanka Trump forwarded the email to Cohen.335  He told the Office that, after receiving \\nthis inquiry, he had conducted an internet search for Klokov’s name and concluded (incorrectly) \\n   \\nthat Klokov was a former Olympic weightlifter.336 \\n\\n \\nBetween November 18 and 19, 2015, Klokov and Cohen had at least one telephone call \\nand exchanged several emails.  Describing himself in emails to Cohen as a “trusted person” who \\ncould  offer  the  Campaign  “political  synergy”  and  “synergy  on  a  government  level,”  Klokov \\nrecommended that Cohen travel to Russia to speak with him and an unidentified intermediary. \\nKlokov  said  that  those  conversations  could  facilitate  a  later  meeting  in  Russia  between  the \\n \\ncandidate and an individual Klokov described as “our person of interest.”337  In an email to the \\n   \\nOffice, Erchova later identified the “person of interest” as Russian President Vladimir Putin.338 \\n \\n\\n \\nIn the telephone call and follow-on emails with Klokov, Cohen discussed his desire to use \\na near-term trip to Russia to do site surveys and talk over the Trump Moscow project with local \\ndevelopers.  Cohen  registered  his  willingness  also  to  meet  with  Klokov  and  the  unidentified \\nintermediary, but was emphatic that all meetings in Russia involving him or candidate Trump— \\nincluding  a  possible  meeting  between  candidate  Trump  and  Putin—would  need  to  be  “in \\nconjunction with the development and an official visit” with the Trump Organization receiving a \\n \\nformal invitation to visit.339  (Klokov had written previously that “the visit [by candidate Trump \\n  \\nto Russia] has to be informal.”)340 \\n \\n\\nKlokov had also previously recommended to Cohen that he separate their negotiations over \\n \\na possible meeting between Trump and “the person of interest” from any existing business track.341 \\nRe-emphasizing that his outreach was not done on behalf of any business, Klokov added in second \\n \\nemail to Cohen that, if publicized well, such a meeting could have “phenomenal” impact “in a \\nbusiness dimension” and that the “person of interest[’s]” “most important support” could have \\n \\nsignificant ramifications for the “level of projects and their capacity.”  Klokov concluded by telling \\n                                                 \\n\\n335 11/16/15 Email, I.

Cohen explained that he \\ndid not pursue the proposed meeting because he was already working on the Moscow Project with \\nSater, who Cohen understood to have his own connections to the Russian government.344 \\n   \\n \\n\\nBy late December 2015, however, Cohen was complaining that Sater had not been able to \\nuse those connections to set up the promised meeting with Russian government officials.  Cohen \\ntold Sater that he was “setting up the meeting myself.”345  On January 11, 2016, Cohen emailed \\n \\nthe office of Dmitry Peskov, the Russian government’s press secretary, indicating that he desired \\ncontact  with  Sergei  Ivanov,  Putin’s  chief  of  staff.  Cohen  erroneously  used  the  email  address \\n“Pr_peskova@prpress.gof.ru” instead of “Pr_peskova@prpress.gov.ru,” so the email apparently \\ndid  not  go \\nthrough.346  On  January  14,  2016,  Cohen  emailed  a  different  address \\n(info@prpress.gov.ru) with the following message:  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nDear Mr. Peskov, \\n \\nOver the past few months, I have been working with a company based in Russia regarding \\n \\nthe development of a Trump Tower-Moscow project in Moscow City. \\n \\nWithout  getting  into  lengthy  specifics,  the  communication  between  our  two  sides  has \\nstalled.

Writing from her personal email account, Poliakova stated that she had been trying to \\nreach Cohen and asked that he call her on the personal number that she provided.350  Shortly after \\nreceiving Poliakova’s email, Cohen called and spoke to her for 20 minutes.351  Cohen described to \\nPoliakova  his  position  at  the  Trump  Organization  and  outlined  the  proposed  Trump  Moscow \\nproject, including information about the Russian counterparty with which the Trump Organization \\nhad partnered.  Cohen requested assistance in moving the project forward, both in securing land to \\nbuild the project and with financing.  According to Cohen, Poliakova asked detailed questions and \\n   \\ntook notes, stating that she would need to follow up with others in Russia.352 \\n\\n \\nCohen  could  not  recall  any  direct  follow-up  from  Poliakova  or  from  any  other \\nrepresentative  of  the  Russian  government,  nor  did  the  Office  identify  any  evidence  of  direct \\n \\nfollow-up.  However, the day after Cohen’s call with Poliakova, Sater texted Cohen, asking him \\n \\nto “[c]all me when you have a few minutes to chat . . .

Beginning in late 2015, \\nSater repeatedly tried to arrange for Cohen and candidate Trump, as representatives of the Trump \\nOrganization, to travel to Russia to meet with Russian government officials and possible financing \\npartners.  In December 2015, Sater sent Cohen a number of emails about logistics for traveling to \\nRussia for meetings.358  On December 19, 2015, Sater wrote: \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n   \\n\\nPlease call me I have Evgeney [Dvoskin] on the other line.[359]  He needs a copy of your \\n \\nand Donald’s passports they need a scan of every page of the passports.

On April 20, 2016, Sater wrote Cohen, “[t]he People \\nwanted to know when you are coming?”364  On May 4, 2016, Sater followed up:  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\nI had a chat with Moscow.

Sater told the Office that he was informed by a business associate \\nthat Peskov wanted to invite Cohen to the Forum.367  On May 5, 2016, Sater wrote to Cohen: \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\nPeskov would like to invite you as his guest to the St. Petersburg Forum which is Russia’s \\nDavos it’s June 16-19.

Cohen was concerned \\nthat Russian officials were not actually involved or were not interested in meeting with him (as \\nSater had alleged), and so he decided not to go to the Forum.373  On June 14, 2016, Cohen met \\nSater in the lobby of the Trump Tower in New York and informed him that he would not be \\n \\ntraveling at that time.374 \\n \\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nii.  Candidate Trump’s Opportunities to Travel to Russia \\n\\n \\n\\nThe investigation identified evidence that, during the period the Trump Moscow project \\nwas under consideration, the possibility of candidate Trump visiting Russia arose in two contexts.   \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\nFirst, in interviews with the Office, Cohen stated that he discussed the subject of traveling \\nto Russia with Trump twice:  once in late 2015; and again in spring 2016.375  According to Cohen, \\n \\nTrump indicated a willingness to travel if it would assist the project significantly. On one occasion, \\nTrump told Cohen to speak with then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to coordinate the \\ncandidate’s schedule.  Cohen recalled that he spoke with Lewandowski, who suggested that they \\nspeak again when Cohen had actual dates to evaluate.  Cohen indicated, however, that he knew \\nthat travel prior to the Republican National Convention would be impossible given the candidate’s \\n   \\npreexisting commitments to the Campaign.376 \\n\\n \\n \\nSecond, like Cohen, Trump received and turned down an invitation to the St. Petersburg \\nInternational Economic Forum.  In late December 2015, Mira Duma—a contact of Ivanka Trump’s \\n \\nfrom the fashion industry—first passed along invitations for Ivanka Trump and candidate Trump \\nfrom Sergei Prikhodko, a Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation.377  On January 14, \\n2016,  Rhona  Graff  sent  an  email  to  Duma  stating  that  Trump  was  “honored  to  be  asked  to \\nparticipate  in  the  highly  prestigious”  Forum  event,  but  that  he  would  “have  to  decline”  the \\n \\ninvitation given his “very grueling and full travel schedule” as a presidential candidate.378   Graff \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                                 \\n\\n370 FS00018 (6/9/16 Text Messages, Sater & Cohen). \\n371 6/13/16 Email, Sater to Cohen (2:10 p.m.). \\n372 FS00018 (6/13/16 Text Message, Sater to Cohen (2:20 p.m.)); 6/13/16 Email, Sater to Cohen. \\n \\n373 Cohen 9/12/18 302, at 6-8. \\n374 FS00019 (6/14/16 Text Messages, Cohen & Sater (12:06 and 2:50 p.m.)). \\n375 Cohen 9/12/18 302, at 2. \\n \\n376 Cohen 9/12/18 302, at 7. \\n \\n377  12/21/15 Email, Mira to Ivanka Trump (6:57 a.m.) (attachments); TRUMPORG_16_000057 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(1/7/16 Email, I.

P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nasked  Duma  whether  she  recommended  that  Graff  “send  a  formal  note  to  the  Deputy  Prime \\n \\nMinister” declining his invitation; Duma replied that a formal note would be “great.”379 \\n\\n \\n \\nIt does not appear that Graff prepared that note immediately.  According to written answers \\nfrom  President  Trump,380  Graff  received  an  email  from  Deputy  Prime  Minister  Prikhodko  on \\nMarch 17, 2016, again inviting Trump to participate in the 2016 Forum in St. Petersburg.381  Two \\n \\nweeks  later,  on  March  31,  2016,  Graff  prepared  for  Trump’s  signature  a  two-paragraph  letter \\n \\ndeclining  the  invitation.382  The  letter  stated  that  Trump’s  “schedule  has  become  extremely \\ndemanding” because of the presidential campaign, that he “already ha[d] several commitments in \\nthe United States” for the time of the Forum, but that he otherwise “would have gladly given every \\nconsideration  to  attending  such  an  important  event.”383  Graff  forwarded  the  letter  to  another \\nexecutive assistant at the Trump Organization with instructions to print the document on letterhead \\nfor Trump to sign.384 \\n \\n\\n              \\n\\n   \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n   \\n\\nAt approximately the same time that the letter was being prepared, Robert Foresman—a \\nNew York-based investment banker—began reaching out to Graff to secure an in-person meeting \\nwith candidate Trump.  According to Foresman, he had been asked by Anton Kobyakov, a Russian \\npresidential aide involved with the Roscongress Foundation, to see if Trump could speak at the \\nForum.385  Foresman  first  emailed  Graff  on  March  31,  2016,  following  a  phone  introduction \\nbrokered through Trump business associate Mark Burnett (who produced the television show The \\nApprentice).  In  his  email,  Foresman  referenced  his  long-standing  personal  and  professional \\n \\nexpertise in Russia and Ukraine, his work setting up an early “private channel” between Vladimir \\nPutin and former U.S. President George W. Bush, and an “approach” he had received from “senior \\nKremlin officials” about the candidate.  Foresman asked Graff for a meeting with the candidate, \\nCorey  Lewandowski,  or  “another  relevant  person”  to  discuss  this  and  other  “concrete  things” \\n \\nForesman  felt  uncomfortable  discussing  over  “unsecure  email.”386  On  April  4,  2016,  Graff \\nforwarded  Foresman’s  meeting  request  to  Jessica  Macchia,  another  executive  assistant \\n  \\nto Trump.387 \\n                                                 \\n\\n379 1/15/16 Email, Mira to Graff. \\n380  As explained in Volume II and Appendix C, on September 17, 2018, the Office sent written \\nquestions to the President’s counsel.

According to Foresman, the “concrete things” he referenced in the same email were \\n \\na  combination  of  the  invitation  itself,  Foresman’s  personal  perspectives  on  the  invitation  and \\nRussia policy in general, and details of a Ukraine plan supported by a U.S. think tank (EastWest \\n \\nInstitute).  Foresman told the Office that Kobyakov had extended similar invitations through him \\n \\nto another Republican presidential candidate and one other politician.  Foresman also said that \\n \\nKobyakov had asked Foresman to invite Trump to speak after that other presidential candidate \\n \\nwithdrew  from  the  race  and  the  other  politician’s  participation  did  not  work  out.392  Finally, \\nForesman  claimed  to  have  no  plans  to  establish  a  back  channel  involving  Trump,  stating  the \\n \\nreference to his involvement in the Bush-Putin back channel was meant to burnish his credentials \\nto the Campaign.  Foresman commented that he had not recognized any of the experts announced \\nas Trump’s foreign policy team in March 2016, and wanted to secure an in-person meeting with \\nthe candidate to share his professional background and policy views, including that Trump should \\n   \\ndecline Kobyakov’s invitation to speak at the Forum.393 \\n\\n   \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n2.

Throughout the relevant period of time \\nand for several months thereafter, Papadopoulos worked with Mifsud and two Russian nationals \\n \\nto arrange a meeting between the Campaign and the Russian government.

Additional George Papadopoulos Contact \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nThe Office investigated another Russia-related contact with Papadopoulos.  The Office was \\nnot fully able to explore the contact because the individual at issue—Sergei Millian—remained \\nout of the country since the inception of our investigation and declined to meet with members of \\n  \\nthe Office despite our repeated efforts to obtain an interview. \\n\\n  \\n \\nPapadopoulos first connected with Millian via LinkedIn on July 15, 2016, shortly after \\n \\nPapadopoulos had attended the TAG Summit with Clovis.500  Millian, an American citizen who is \\na native of Belarus, introduced himself “as president of [the] New York-based Russian American \\nChamber of Commerce,” and claimed that through that position he had “insider knowledge and \\ndirect access to the top hierarchy in Russian politics.”501  Papadopoulos asked Timofeev whether \\nhe had heard of Millian.502  Although Timofeev said no,503 Papadopoulos met Millian in New York \\n \\nCity.504  The meetings took place on July 30 and August 1, 2016.505  Afterwards, Millian invited \\n \\nPapadopoulos  to  attend—and  potentially  speak  at—two  international  energy  conferences, \\nincluding one that was to be held in Moscow in September 2016.506  Papadopoulos ultimately did \\nnot attend either conference. \\n \\n\\nOn  July  31,  2016,  following  his  first  in-person  meeting  with  Millian,  Papadopoulos \\nemailed Trump Campaign official Bo Denysyk to say that he had been contacted “by some leaders \\nof Russian-American voters here in the US about their interest in voting for Mr. Trump,” and to \\n  \\nask whether he should “put you in touch with their group (US-Russia chamber of commerce).”507 \\nDenysyk  thanked  Papadopoulos  “for  taking  the  initiative,”  but  asked  him  to  “hold  off  with \\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                                 \\n\\n499 \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n500 7/15/16 LinkedIn Message, Millian to Papadopoulos.  \\n501 7/15/16 LinkedIn Message, Millian to Papadopoulos. \\n502  7/22/16  Facebook  Message,  Papadopoulos  to  Timofeev  (7:40:23  p.m.);  7/26/16  Facebook \\n\\n \\n\\nMessage, Papadopoulos to Timofeev (3:08:57 p.m.). \\n\\n503  7/23/16  Facebook  Message,  Timofeev  to  Papadopoulos  (4:31:37  a.m.);  7/26/16  Facebook \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMessage, Timofeev to Papadopoulos (3:37:16 p.m.). \\n\\n504 7/16/16 Text Messages, Papadopoulos & Millian (7:55:43 p.m.). \\n \\n505  7/30/16 Text Messages, Papadopoulos & Millian (5:38 & 6:05 p.m.); 7/31/16 Text Messages, \\n \\nMillian & Papadopoulos (3:48 & 4:18 p.m.); 8/1/16 Text Message, Millian to Papadopoulos (8:19 p.m.).      \\n506 8/2/16 Text Messages, Millian & Papadopoulos (3:04 & 3:05 p.m.); 8/3/16 Facebook Messages, \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPapadopoulos & Millian (4:07:37 a.m. & 1:11:58 p.m.).  \\n\\n507 7/31/16 Email, Papadopoulos to Denysyk (12:29:59 p.m.). \\n\\n \\n\\n94 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

Background \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\nBefore he began working for the Campaign in January 2016, Page had substantial prior \\nexperience studying Russian policy issues and living and working in Moscow.  From 2004 to 2007, \\nPage was the deputy branch manager of Merrill Lynch’s Moscow office.517  There, he worked on \\n \\ntransactions  involving  the  Russian  energy  company  Gazprom  and  came  to  know  Gazprom’s \\n   \\ndeputy chief financial officer, Sergey Yatsenko.518 \\n \\n\\n \\nIn 2008, Page founded Global Energy Capital LLC (GEC), an investment management and \\n \\n \\n \\n520  The company otherwise had no sources of income, and \\nPage  was  forced  to  draw  down  his  life  savings  to  support  himself  and  pursue  his  business \\nventure.521  Page asked Yatsenko to work with him at GEC as a senior advisor on a contingency \\n \\nbasis, \\n\\nadvisory firm focused on the energy sector in emerging markets.519\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n.522\\n\\n   \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n \\nIn 2008, Page met Alexander Bulatov, a Russian government official who worked at the \\n \\nRussian Consulate in New York.523  Page later learned that Bulatov was a Russian intelligence \\n   \\n. 524 \\nofficer, \\n \\n \\nIn 2013, Victor Podobnyy, another Russian intelligence officer working covertly in the \\nUnited States under diplomatic cover, formed a relationship with Page.525  Podobnyy met Page at \\nan energy symposium in New York City and began exchanging emails with him.526  Podobnyy \\nand Page also met in person on multiple occasions, during which Page offered his outlook on the \\n  \\nfuture of the energy industry and provided documents to Podobnyy about the energy business.527 \\n \\nIn a recorded conversation on April 8, 2013, Podobnyy told another intelligence officer that Page \\nwas interested in business opportunities in Russia.528  In Podobnyy’s words, Page “got hooked on \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                                 \\n\\n517 Testimony of Carter Page, Hearing Before the U.S. House of Representatives, Permanent Select \\n\\n \\n\\nCommittee on Intelligence, 115th Cong. 40 (Nov. 2, 2017) (exhibit). \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nGrand Jury\\nGrand Jury\\nGrand Jury\\n\\n518 Page 3/30/17 302, at 10. \\n \\n519 \\n \\n520 \\n \\n521 \\n \\n522 Page 3/30/17 302, at 10; Grand Jury\\n \\n523 \\n \\n524 \\n \\n525 \\n\\nGrand Jury\\nGrand Jury\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nmj-215 (S.D.N.Y.

For example, on January 30, 2016, Page sent an email to senior \\n \\nCampaign officials stating that he had “spent the past week in Europe and ha[d] been in discussions \\n \\nwith some individuals with close ties to the Kremlin” who recognized that Trump could have a \\n \\n“game-changing effect . . . in bringing the end of the new Cold War.”542  The email stated that \\n \\n“[t]hrough [his] discussions with these high level contacts,” Page believed that “a direct meeting \\nin Moscow between Mr[.] Trump and Putin could be arranged.”543  Page closed the email by \\n \\n   \\ncriticizing  U.S.  sanctions  on  Russia.544 \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\nOn March 21, 2016, candidate Trump formally and publicly identified Page as a member \\nof his foreign policy team to advise on Russia and the energy sector.546  Over the next several \\nmonths,  Page  continued  providing  policy-related  work  product  to  Campaign  officials.  For \\nexample, in April 2016, Page provided feedback on an outline for a foreign policy speech that the \\ncandidate gave at the Mayflower Hotel,547 see Volume I, Section IV.A.4, infra.  In May 2016, Page \\nprepared an outline of an energy policy speech for the Campaign and then traveled to Bismarck, \\n \\nNorth Dakota, to watch the candidate deliver the speech.548  Chief policy advisor Sam Clovis \\n \\nexpressed appreciation for Page’s work and praised his work to other Campaign officials.549 \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nc. Carter Page’s July 2016 Trip To Moscow \\n\\n \\n \\nPage’s affiliation with the Trump Campaign took on a higher profile and drew the attention \\n \\nof Russian officials after the candidate named him a foreign policy advisor.  As a result, in late \\nApril 2016, Page was invited to give a speech at the July 2016 commencement ceremony at the \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n   \\n545 \\n\\n                                                 \\n\\n \\n\\n541  See, e.g., 1/30/16 Email, Page to Glassner et al.; 3/17/16 Email, Page to Clovis (attaching a \\n \\n“President’s Daily Brief” prepared by Page that discussed the “severe degradation of U.S.-Russia relations \\nfollowing Washington’s meddling” in Ukraine); \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n542 1/30/16 Email, Page to Glassner et al.   \\n  \\n543 1/30/16 Email, Page to Glassner et al.   \\n  \\n544 1/30/16 Email, Page to Glassner et al.   \\n  \\n545 \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n546  A  Transcript  of  Donald  Trump’s  Meeting  with  the  Washington  Post  Editorial  Board, \\n\\nWashington Post (Mar. 21, 2016); \\n\\n \\n\\nGrand Jury\\nGrand Jury\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n547 \\n \\n548 \\n \\n\\n \\n549 See, e.g., 3/28/16 Email, Clovis to Lewandowski et al.

Gordon, and Walid Phares and suggested that \\n \\ncandidate Trump take his place speaking at the commencement ceremony in Moscow.557  On June \\n19, 2016, Page followed up again to request approval to speak at the NES event and to reiterate \\n  \\nthat NES “would love to have Mr. Trump speak at this annual celebration” in Page’s place.558 \\nCampaign manager Corey Lewandowski responded the same day, saying, “If you want to do this, \\nit would be out side [sic] of your role with the DJT for President campaign.

CNI is a think tank with expertise in and connections to the Russian government.  Simes \\n \\nwas born in the former Soviet Union and immigrated to the United States in the 1970s.  In April \\n2016, candidate Trump delivered his first speech on foreign policy and national security at an event \\nhosted by the National Interest, a publication affiliated with CNI.  Then-Senator Jeff Sessions and \\nRussian Ambassador Kislyak both attended the event and, as a result, it gained some attention in \\nrelation to Sessions’s confirmation hearings to become Attorney General.  Sessions had various \\n \\nother contacts with CNI during the campaign period on foreign-policy matters, including Russia. \\n  \\nJared  Kushner  also  interacted  with  Simes  about  Russian  issues  during  the  campaign.  The \\ninvestigation did not identify evidence that the Campaign passed or received any messages to or \\nfrom the Russian government through CNI or Simes.    \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\na.

As CNI stated when seeking a grant from the Carnegie \\nCorporation  in  2015,  CNI  has “unparalleled  access to  Russian  officials  and  politicians among \\nWashington think tanks,”599 in part because CNI has arranged for U.S. delegations to visit Russia \\nand for Russian delegations to visit the United States as part of so-called “Track II” diplomatic \\nefforts.600 \\n \\n\\n \\nOn March 14, 2016, CNI board member Richard Plepler organized a luncheon for CNI and \\nits honorary chairman, Henry Kissinger, at the Time Warner Building in New York.601  The idea \\n  \\nbehind the event was to generate interest in CNI’s work and recruit new board members for CNI.602 \\nAlong  with  Simes,  attendees  at  the  event  included  Jared  Kushner,  son-in-law  of  candidate \\nTrump.603 Kushner told the Office that the event came at a time when the Trump Campaign was \\nhaving trouble securing support from experienced foreign policy professionals and that, as a result, \\n   \\nhe decided to seek Simes’s assistance during the March 14 event.604 \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n \\nSimes and Kushner spoke again on a March 24, 2016 telephone call,605  three days after \\nTrump had publicly named the team of foreign policy advisors that had been put together on short \\nnotice.606  On  March  31,  2016,  Simes  and  Kushner  had  an  in-person,  one-on-one  meeting  in \\nKushner’s New York office.607  During that meeting, Simes told Kushner that the best way to \\nhandle foreign-policy issues for the Trump Campaign would be to organize an advisory group of \\nexperts to meet with candidate Trump and develop a foreign policy approach that was consistent \\n \\nwith Trump’s voice.608  Simes believed that Kushner was receptive to that suggestion.609 \\n\\n \\nSimes  also  had  contact  with  other  individuals  associated  with  the  Trump  Campaign \\nregarding the Campaign’s foreign policy positions.  For example, on June 17, 2016, Simes sent \\n \\nJ.D.

National Interest Hosts a Foreign Policy Speech at the Mayflower Hotel \\n\\n \\nDuring both their March 24 phone call and their March 31 in-person meeting, Simes and \\nKushner discussed the possibility of CNI hosting a foreign policy speech by candidate Trump.611 \\n \\nFollowing  those  conversations,  Simes  agreed  that  he  and  others  associated  with  CNI  would \\nprovide  behind-the-scenes  input  on  the  substance  of  the  foreign-policy  speech  and  that  CNI \\nofficials  would  coordinate  the  logistics  of  the  speech  with  Sessions  and  his  staff,  including \\nSessions’s chief of staff, Rick Dearborn.612 \\n\\n       \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn mid-April 2016, Kushner put Simes in contact with senior policy advisor Stephen Miller \\n \\nand forwarded to Simes an outline of the foreign-policy speech that Miller had prepared.613  Simes \\n \\nsent back to the Campaign bullet points with ideas for the speech that he had drafted with CNI \\n \\nExecutive Director Paul Saunders and board member Richard Burt.614  Simes received subsequent \\ndraft  outlines  from  Miller,  and  he  and  Saunders  spoke  to  Miller  by  phone  about  substantive \\nchanges to the speech.615  It is not clear, however, whether CNI officials received an actual draft \\nof the speech for comment; while Saunders recalled having received an actual draft, Simes did not, \\nand the emails that CNI produced to this Office do not contain such a draft.616 \\n \\n\\n \\nAfter board members expressed concern to Simes that CNI’s hosting the speech could be \\nperceived as an endorsement of a particular candidate, CNI decided to have its publication, the \\n \\nNational Interest, serve as the host and to have the event at the National Press Club.617  Kushner \\nlater requested that the event be moved to the Mayflower Hotel, which was another venue that \\nSimes had mentioned during initial discussions with the Campaign, in order to address concerns \\nabout security and capacity.618 \\n   \\n\\n          \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                                 \\n\\n610 C00008187 (6/17/16 Email, Simes to Gordon (3:35:45 p.m.)). \\n611 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 7. \\n \\n612 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 8-11; C00008923 (4/6/16 Email, Simes to Burt (2:22:28 p.m.)); Burt 2/9/18 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n302, at 7. \\n\\n613  C00008551  (4/17/16  Email,  Kushner  to  Simes  (2:44:25  p.m.));  C00006759  (4/14/16  Email \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nKushner to Simes & S.

The two shook hands and chatted for a minute or two, during which Kushner \\nrecalled Kislyak saying, “we like what your candidate is saying . . . it’s refreshing.”628 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nSeveral  public  reports  state  that,  in  addition  to  speaking  to  Kushner  at  the  pre-speech \\n \\nreception,  Kislyak  also  met  or  conversed  with  Sessions  at  that  time.629  Sessions  stated  to \\n \\ninvestigators, however, that he did not remember any such conversation.630  Nor did anyone else \\naffiliated with CNI or the National Interest specifically recall a conversation or meeting between \\nSessions and Kislyak at the pre-speech reception.631  It appears that, if a conversation occurred at \\nthe pre-speech reception, it was a brief one conducted in public view, similar to the exchange \\nbetween Kushner and Kislyak. \\n                                                 \\n\\n619 Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 11-12; C00006651-57 (Mayflower Group Sales Agreement). \\n620 Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 12-13. \\n \\n621 Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 12. \\n \\n622 C00002575 (Attendee List); C00008536 (4/25/16 Email, Simes to Kushner (4:53:45 p.m.)).  \\n623 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 19-20. \\n624 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 21. \\n \\n625 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 21. \\n \\n626 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 21. \\n \\n627 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 21. \\n \\n628 Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 4.  \\n629  See, e.g., Ken Dilanian, Did Trump, Kushner, Sessions Have an Undisclosed Meeting With \\n \\nRussian?, NBC News (June 1, 2016); Julia Ioffe, Why Did Jeff Sessions Really Meet With Sergey Kislyak, \\nThe Atlantic (June 13, 2017). \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n630 Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 22. \\n \\n631 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 21; Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 14, 21; Boyd 1/24/18 302, at 3-4; Heilbrunn \\n2/1/18 302, at 6; Statement Regarding President Trump’s April 27, 2016 Foreign Policy Speech at the \\n \\nCenter for the National Interest, CNI (Mar. 8, 2017). \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n106 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

The meeting was proposed to Donald Trump Jr. in an email from Robert \\nGoldstone, at the request of his then-client Emin Agalarov, the son of Russian real-estate developer \\nAras Agalarov.  Goldstone relayed to Trump Jr. that the “Crown prosecutor of Russia . . . offered \\n \\nto  provide  the  Trump  Campaign  with  some  official  documents  and  information  that  would \\n \\nincriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia” as “part of Russia and its government’s support \\nfor Mr. Trump.”  Trump Jr. immediately responded that “if it’s what you say I love it,” and arranged \\nthe meeting through a series of emails and telephone calls.  \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\nTrump Jr. invited campaign chairman Paul Manafort and senior advisor Jared Kushner to \\nattend the meeting, and both attended.  Members of the Campaign discussed the meeting before it \\noccurred, and Michael Cohen recalled that Trump Jr. may have told candidate Trump about an \\nupcoming meeting to receive adverse information about Clinton, without linking the meeting to \\nRussia.  According to written answers submitted by President Trump, he has no recollection of \\nlearning of the meeting at the time, and the Office found no documentary evidence showing that he \\nwas made aware of the meeting—or its Russian connection—before it occurred. \\n \\n\\nThe  Russian  attorney  who  spoke  at  the  meeting,  Natalia  Veselnitskaya,  had  previously \\n \\nworked for the Russian government and maintained a relationship with that government throughout \\nthis period of time.  She claimed that funds derived from illegal activities in Russia were provided \\n \\nto Hillary Clinton and other Democrats.  Trump Jr. requested evidence to support those claims, but \\nVeselnitskaya did not provide such information.  She and her associates then turned to a critique of \\n \\nthe origins of the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 statute that imposed financial and travel sanctions on \\nRussian officials and that resulted in a retaliatory ban on adoptions of Russian children. Trump Jr. \\n \\nsuggested that the issue could be revisited when and if candidate Trump was elected.  After the \\nelection,  Veselnitskaya  made  additional  efforts  to  follow  up  on  the  meeting,  but  the  Trump \\nTransition Team did not engage.         \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\na.

Trump (Nov. 20, 2018), at 8 (Response to Question I, Parts (a)-\\n(c)).  We considered whether one sequence of events suggested that candidate Trump had contemporaneous \\n \\nknowledge of the June 9 meeting.  On June 7, 2016 Trump announced his intention to give “a major speech” \\n“probably Monday of next week”—which would have been June 13—about “all of the things that have \\ntaken place with the Clintons.”  See, e.g., Phillip Bump, What we know about the Trump Tower meeting, \\nWashington Post (Aug. 7, 2018).  Following the June 9 meeting, Trump changed the subject of his planned \\n \\nspeech to national security.  But the Office did not find evidence that the original idea for the speech was \\nconnected to the anticipated June 9 meeting or that the change of topic was attributable to the failure of that \\nmeeting to produce concrete evidence about Clinton.  Other events, such as the Pulse nightclub shooting \\n \\non June 12, could well have caused the change.  The President’s written answers to our questions state that \\nthe speech’s focus was altered “[i]n light of” the Pulse nightclub shooting.

Gordon,  a  senior  Campaign  advisor  on  policy  and  national  security,  diluted  a  proposed \\namendment to the Republican Party platform expressing support for providing “lethal” assistance \\n \\nto  Ukraine  in  response  to  Russian  aggression.  Gordon  requested  that  platform  committee \\npersonnel revise the proposed amendment to state that only “appropriate” assistance be provided \\nto Ukraine.  The original sponsor of the “lethal” assistance amendment stated that Gordon told her \\n(the sponsor) that he was on the phone with candidate Trump in connection with his request to \\n \\ndilute  the  language.  Gordon  denied  making  that  statement  to  the  sponsor,  although  he \\nacknowledged it was possible he mentioned having previously spoken to the candidate about the \\nsubject matter.  The investigation did not establish that Gordon spoke to or was directed by the \\ncandidate to make that proposal.  Gordon said that he sought the change because he believed the \\nproposed language was inconsistent with Trump’s position on Ukraine.   \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\na.

Gates periodically sent such \\npolling data to Kilimnik during the campaign. \\n                                                 \\n\\n834 Luff 1/30/18 302, at 6; Landrum 2/27/18 302, at 4-5. \\n \\n835 Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 23. \\n836 Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 23. \\n837 Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 23. \\n838  On August 21, 2018, Manafort was convicted in the Eastern District of Virginia on eight tax, \\n \\n \\nForeign Bank Account Registration (FBAR), and bank fraud charges.  On September 14, 2018, Manafort \\npleaded guilty in the District of Columbia to (1) conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to \\n \\ncommit  offenses  against  the  United  States  (money  laundering,  tax  fraud,  FBAR,  Foreign  Agents \\nRegistration Act (FARA), and FARA false statements), and (2) conspiracy  to obstruct justice (witness \\ntampering).  Manafort  also  admitted  criminal  conduct  with  which  he  had  been  charged  in  the  Eastern \\n \\nDistrict of Virginia, but as to which the jury hung.  The conduct at issue in both cases involved Manafort’s \\nwork in Ukraine and the money he earned for that work, as well as crimes after the Ukraine work ended.  \\nOn March 7, 2019, Manafort was sentenced to 47 months of imprisonment in the Virginia prosecution.  On \\n \\nMarch 13, the district court in D.C. sentenced Manafort to a total term of 73 months:  60 months on the \\n \\nCount 1 conspiracy (with 30 of those months to run concurrent to the Virginia sentence), and 13 months on \\nthe Count 1 conspiracy, to be served consecutive to the other two sentences.  The two sentences resulted in \\na total term of 90 months. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n839 As noted in Volume I, Section III.D.1.b, supra, Gates pleaded guilty to two criminal charges in \\nthe District of Columbia, including making a false statement to the FBI, pursuant to a plea agreement.

The second meeting took place on August 2, 2016, in New York \\nCity.  Kilimnik  requested  the  meeting  to  deliver  in  person  a  message  from  former  Ukrainian \\nPresident Viktor Yanukovych, who was then living in Russia.  The message was about a peace \\n \\nplan for Ukraine that Manafort has since acknowledged was a “backdoor” means for Russia to \\ncontrol eastern Ukraine.  Several months later, after the presidential election, Kilimnik wrote an \\nemail to Manafort expressing the view—which Manafort later said he shared—that the plan’s \\nsuccess would require U.S. support to succeed: “all that is required to start the process is a very \\n \\nminor ‘wink’ (or slight push) from [Donald Trump].”840  The email also stated that if Manafort \\n \\nwere designated as the U.S. representative and started the process, Yanukovych would ensure his \\nreception in Russia “at the very top level.” \\n \\n\\nManafort  communicated  with  Kilimnik  about  peace  plans  for  Ukraine  on  at  least  four \\noccasions after their first discussion of the topic on August 2:  December 2016 (the Kilimnik email \\ndescribed above); January 2017; February 2017; and again in the spring of 2018.  The Office \\nreviewed numerous Manafort email and text communications, and asked President Trump about \\n \\nthe plan in written questions.841  The investigation did not uncover evidence of Manafort’s passing \\n \\nalong information about Ukrainian peace plans to the candidate or anyone else in the Campaign or \\nthe  Administration.  The  Office  was  not,  however,  able  to  gain  access  to  all  of  Manafort’s \\nelectronic communications (in some instances, messages were sent using encryption applications).  \\nAnd  while  Manafort  denied  that  he  spoke  to  members  of  the  Trump  Campaign  or  the  new \\nAdministration about the peace plan, he lied to the Office and the grand jury about the peace plan \\nand his meetings with Kilimnik, and his unreliability on this subject was among the reasons that \\nthe district judge found that he breached his cooperation agreement.842 \\n \\n\\nThe Office could not reliably determine Manafort’s purpose in sharing internal polling data \\n \\nwith Kilimnik during the campaign period.  Manafort \\ndid not see \\na downside to sharing campaign information, and told Gates that his role in the Campaign would \\n\\n      \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                                 \\n\\n840 The email was drafted in Kilimnik’s DMP email account (in English) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n841 According to the President’s written answers, he does not remember Manafort communicating \\nto him any particular positions that Ukraine or Russia would want the United States to support.  Written \\nResponses of Donald J.

Based on that conduct, the Office \\n \\n \\ndetermined that Manafort had breached his plea agreement and could not be a cooperating witness.  The \\njudge presiding in Manafort’s D.C. criminal case found by a preponderance of the evidence that Manafort \\nintentionally  made  multiple  false  statements  to  the  FBI,  the  Office,  and  the  grand  jury  concerning  his \\n \\ninteractions and communications with Kilimnik (and concerning two other issues).  Although the report \\n \\nrefers at times to Manafort’s statements, it does so only when those statements are sufficiently corroborated \\nto  be  trustworthy,  to  identify  issues  on  which  Manafort’s  untruthful  responses  may  themselves  be  of \\n \\nevidentiary value, or to provide Manafort’s explanations for certain events, even when we were unable to \\ndetermine whether that explanation was credible.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n130 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

As to Deripaska, Manafort claimed that by sharing campaign information with \\nhim, Deripaska might see value in their relationship and resolve a “disagreement”—a reference to \\n \\none  or  more  outstanding lawsuits.  Because  of questions about  Manafort’s credibility  and  our \\nlimited ability to gather evidence on what happened to the polling data after it was sent to Kilimnik, \\nthe Office could not assess what Kilimnik (or others he may have given it to) did with it.  The \\nOffice did not identify evidence of a connection between Manafort’s sharing polling data and \\n \\nRussia’s interference in the election, which had already been reported by U.S. media outlets at the \\ntime  of  the  August  2  meeting.  The  investigation  did  not  establish  that  Manafort  otherwise \\n \\ncoordinated with the Russian government on its election-interference efforts. \\n \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\na.  Paul Manafort’s Ties to Russia and Ukraine \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nManafort’s Russian  contacts  during the  campaign  and  transition  periods  stem  from  his \\nconsulting  work  for  Deripaska  from  approximately  2005  to  2009  and  his  separate  political \\nconsulting work in Ukraine from 2005 to 2015, including through his company DMP International \\nLLC (DMI).  Kilimnik worked for Manafort in Kiev during this entire period and continued to \\ncommunicate  with  Manafort  through  at  least  June  2018.  Kilimnik,  who  speaks  and  writes \\n \\nUkrainian  and  Russian,  facilitated  many  of  Manafort’s  communications  with  Deripaska  and \\nUkrainian oligarchs. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\ni.  Oleg Deripaska Consulting Work \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\nIn approximately 2005, Manafort began working for Deripaska, a Russian oligarch who \\n \\nhas a global empire involving aluminum and power companies and who is closely aligned with \\nVladimir Putin.843  A memorandum describing work that Manafort performed for Deripaska in \\n \\n2005 regarding the post-Soviet republics referenced the need to brief the Kremlin and the benefits \\n \\nthat the work could confer on “the Putin Government.”844  Gates described the work Manafort did \\nfor Deripaska as “political risk insurance,” and explained that Deripaska used Manafort to install \\n \\nfriendly  political  officials  in  countries  where  Deripaska  had  business  interests.845    Manafort’s \\n \\n \\ncompany earned tens of millions of dollars from its work for Deripaska and was loaned millions \\n   \\nof dollars by Deripaska as well.846 \\n \\n \\n \\nIn 2007, Deripaska invested through another entity in Pericles Emerging Market Partners \\nL.P. (“Pericles”), an investment fund created by Manafort and former Manafort business partner \\n  \\nRichard Davis.  The Pericles fund was established to pursue investments in Eastern Europe.847 \\nDeripaska was the sole investor.848  Gates stated in interviews with the Office that the venture led \\n                                                 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n843 Pinchuk et al., Russian Tycoon Deripaska in Putin Delegation to China, Reuters (June 8, 2018). \\n  \\n844 6/23/05 Memo, Manafort & Davis to Deripaska & Rothchild.  \\n845 Gates 2/2/18 302, at 7. \\n \\n846  Manafort 9/20/18 302, at 2-5; Manafort Income by Year, 2005 – 2015; Manafort Loans from \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nWire Transfers, 2005 – 2015. \\n\\n847 Gates 3/12/18 302, at 5. \\n \\n848 Manafort 12/16/15 Dep., at 157:8-11. \\n \\n\\n131 \\n\\n \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

Gates  stated  that,  by  2009, \\nManafort’s business relationship with Deripaska had “dried up.”850  According to Gates, various \\ninteractions with Deripaska and his intermediaries over the past few years have involved trying to \\n \\nresolve the legal dispute.851  As described below, in 2016, Manafort, Gates, Kilimnik, and others \\nengaged in efforts to revive the Deripaska relationship and resolve the litigation. \\n\\n \\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nii. \\n \\n\\nPolitical Consulting Work \\n\\nThrough Deripaska, Manafort was introduced to Rinat Akhmetov, a Ukrainian oligarch \\n \\nwho hired Manafort as a political consultant.852  In 2005, Akhmetov hired Manafort to engage in \\n \\npolitical work supporting the Party of Regions,853  a political party in Ukraine that was generally \\nunderstood to align with Russia.  Manafort assisted the Party of Regions in regaining power, and \\n \\nits candidate, Viktor Yanukovych, won the presidency in 2010.  Manafort became a close and \\ntrusted political advisor to Yanukovych during his time as President of Ukraine.  Yanukovych \\nserved in that role until 2014, when he fled to Russia amidst popular protests.854 \\n \\n\\n     \\n\\n   \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\niii.

On March 30, 2016, Gates \\nemailed the memoranda and a press release announcing Manafort’s appointment to Kilimnik for \\ntranslation and dissemination.881  Manafort later followed up with Kilimnik to ensure his messages \\nhad been delivered, emailing on April 11, 2016 to ask whether Kilimnik had shown “our friends” \\nthe media coverage of his new role.882  Kilimnik replied, “Absolutely.

Gates stated that, in \\naccordance with Manafort’s instruction, he periodically sent Kilimnik polling data via WhatsApp; \\n \\nGates then deleted the communications on a daily basis.892  Gates further told the Office that, after \\n \\nManafort left the Campaign in mid-August, Gates sent Kilimnik polling data less frequently and \\n \\nthat the data he sent was more publicly available information and less internal data.893 \\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\nGates’s account about polling data is consistent  \\n\\n \\n \\nwith multiple emails that \\nKilimnik sent to U.S. associates and press contacts between late July and mid-August of 2016.  \\nThose  emails  referenced  “internal  polling,”  described  the  status  of  the  Trump  Campaign  and \\n\\n \\n94 \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                                 \\n\\n885 Gates 2/2/18 302, at 11; Gates 9/27/18 302 (serial 740), at 2. \\n \\n886 Gates 2/2/18 302, at 12. \\n \\n887 Gates 2/2/18 302, at 12. \\n \\n888  Gates 1/31/18 302, at 17; Gates 9/27/18 302 (serial 740), at 2.

The first meeting took place on May 7, 2016, in New York City.905  In \\nthe  days  leading  to  the  meeting,  Kilimnik  had  been  working  to  gather  information  about  the \\npolitical situation in Ukraine.  That included information gleaned from a trip that former Party of \\nRegions official Yuriy Boyko had recently taken to Moscow—a trip that likely included meetings \\n \\nbetween Boyko and high-ranking Russian officials.906  Kilimnik then traveled to Washington, D.C. \\non or about May 5, 2016; while in Washington, Kilimnik had pre-arranged meetings with State \\nDepartment employees.907 \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nLate on the evening of May 6, Gates arranged for Kilimnik to take a 3:00 a.m. train to meet \\nManafort in New York for breakfast on May 7.908  According to Manafort, during the meeting, he \\nand  Kilimnik  talked  about  events  in  Ukraine,  and  Manafort  briefed  Kilimnik  on  the  Trump \\nCampaign,  expecting  Kilimnik  to  pass  the  information  back  to  individuals  in  Ukraine  and \\nelsewhere.909  Manafort stated that Opposition Bloc members recognized Manafort’s position on \\nthe Campaign was an opportunity, but Kilimnik did not ask for anything.910  Kilimnik spoke about \\na plan of Boyko to boost election participation in the eastern zone of Ukraine, which was the base \\nfor the Opposition Bloc.911  Kilimnik returned to Washington, D.C. right after the meeting with \\nManafort. \\n \\n\\nManafort met with Kilimnik a second time at the Grand Havana Club in New York City \\non the evening of August 2, 2016.  The events leading to the meeting are as follows.  On July 28, \\n2016,  Kilimnik  flew  from  Kiev  to  Moscow.912  The  next  day,  Kilimnik  wrote  to  Manafort \\n \\n \\nrequesting that they meet, using coded language about a conversation he had that day.913  In an \\nemail with a subject line “Black Caviar,” Kilimnik wrote: \\n\\n   \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\nI met today with the guy who gave you your biggest black caviar jar several years ago.

According  to  Gates,  it  also  included  discussion  of  “battleground”  states,  which \\n  \\nManafort identified as Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Minnesota.931  Manafort did not \\n \\nrefer explicitly to “battleground” states in his telling of the August 2 discussion, \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n929\\n\\n    \\n\\n32\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n                                                 \\nprime minister.

Despite  his  resignation, \\nManafort continued to offer advice to various Campaign officials through the November election.  \\n \\nManafort told Gates that he still spoke with Kushner, Bannon, and candidate Trump,935 and some \\nof those post-resignation contacts are documented in emails.  For example, on October 21, 2016, \\n \\nManafort  sent  Kushner  an  email  and  attached  a  strategy  memorandum  proposing  that  the \\n \\nCampaign make the case against Clinton “as the failed and corrupt champion of the establishment” \\nand that “Wikileaks provides the Trump campaign the ability to make the case in a very credible \\n \\nway – by using the words of Clinton, its campaign officials and DNC members.”936  Later, in a \\nNovember 5, 2016 email to Kushner entitled “Securing the Victory,” Manafort stated that he was \\n“really feeling good about our prospects on Tuesday and focusing on preserving the victory,” and \\nthat he was concerned the Clinton Campaign would respond to a loss by “mov[ing] immediately \\nto discredit the [Trump] victory and claim voter fraud and cyber-fraud, including the claim that \\nthe Russians have hacked into the voting machines and tampered with the results.”937 \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nTrump was elected President on November 8, 2016.  Manafort told the Office that, in the \\n \\nwake  of  Trump’s  victory,  he  was  not  interested  in  an  Administration  job.  Manafort  instead \\npreferred to stay on the “outside,” and monetize his campaign position to generate business given \\nhis  familiarity  and  relationship  with  Trump  and  the  incoming  Administration.938  Manafort \\nappeared to follow that plan, as he traveled to the Middle East, Cuba, South Korea, Japan, and \\n \\nChina and was paid to explain what a Trump presidency would entail.939 \\n \\n\\n \\nManafort’s activities in early 2017 included meetings relating to Ukraine and Russia.

When he later acknowledged it, he claimed that the meeting \\nhad been arranged by his lawyers and concerned only the Pericles lawsuit.941  Other evidence, \\nhowever, provides reason to doubt Manafort’s statement that the sole topic of the meeting was the \\nPericles lawsuit.  In particular, text messages to Manafort from a number associated with Kilimnik \\n \\nsuggest that Kilimnik and Boyarkin—not Manafort’s counsel—had arranged the meeting between \\nManafort and Oganov.942  Kilimnik’s message states that the meeting was supposed to be “not \\nabout money or Pericles” but instead “about recreating [the] old friendship”—ostensibly between \\nManafort and Deripaska—“and talking about global politics.”943  Manafort also replied by text that \\n \\n \\nhe “need[s] this finished before Jan. 20,”944 which appears to be a reference to resolving Pericles \\nbefore the inauguration. \\n\\n \\nOn  January  15,  2017,  three  days  after  his  return  from Madrid,  Manafort  emailed  K.T. \\nMcFarland, who was at that time designated to be Deputy National Security Advisor and was \\n \\nformally  appointed  to  that  position  on  January  20,  2017.945  Manafort’s  January  15  email  to \\nMcFarland stated: “I have some important information I want to share that I picked up on my \\n \\ntravels  over  the  last  month.”946    Manafort  told  the  Office  that  the  email  referred  to  an  issue \\n  \\nregarding Cuba, not Russia or Ukraine, and Manafort had traveled to Cuba in the past month.947 \\nEither way, McFarland—who was advised by Flynn not to respond to the Manafort inquiry— \\n \\nappears not to have responded to Manafort.948 \\n\\n \\nManafort told the Office that around the time of the Presidential Inauguration in January, \\n \\nhe  met  with  Kilimnik  and  Ukrainian  oligarch  Serhiy  Lyovochkin  at  the  Westin  Hotel  in \\nAlexandria, Virginia.949  During this meeting, Kilimnik again discussed the Yanukovych peace \\n \\nplan that he had broached at the August 2 meeting and in a detailed December 8, 2016 message \\n   \\nIn  that  December  8  email,  which  Manafort \\nfound  in  Kilimnik’s  DMP  email  account.950 \\n                                                 \\n\\n940  Kalashnikova 5/17/18 302, at 4; Gary Lee, Soviet Embassy’s Identity Crisis, Washington Post \\n \\n\\n(Dec. 20, 1991); Georgy S.

In early 2018, Manafort retained his longtime polling firm to craft a draft \\npoll in Ukraine, sent the pollsters a three-page primer on the plan sent by Kilimnik, and worked \\n \\nwith Kilimnik to formulate the polling questions.960  The primer sent to the pollsters specifically \\n \\ncalled for the United States and President Trump to support the Autonomous Republic of Donbas \\n \\nwith Yanukovych as Prime Minister,961 and a series of questions in the draft poll asked for opinions \\non  Yanukovych’s  role  in  resolving  the  conflict  in  Donbas.962  (The  poll  was  not  solely  about \\n \\nDonbas; it also sought participants’ views on leaders apart from Yanukovych as they pertained to \\nthe 2019 Ukraine presidential election.) \\n\\n \\nThe Office has not uncovered evidence that Manafort brought the Ukraine peace plan to \\nthe attention of the Trump Campaign or the Trump Administration.

Post-Election and Transition-Period Contacts   \\n\\n \\n \\nTrump  was  elected  President  on  November  8,  2016.  Beginning  immediately  after  the \\nelection,  individuals  connected  to  the  Russian  government  started  contacting  officials  on  the \\nTrump Campaign and Transition Team through multiple channels—sometimes through Russian \\n \\nAmbassador Kislyak and at other times through individuals who sought reliable contacts through \\nU.S. persons not formally tied to the Campaign or Transition Team.  The most senior levels of the \\n \\nRussian government encouraged these efforts.  The investigation did not establish that these efforts \\nreflected or constituted coordination between the Trump Campaign and Russia in its election-\\n \\ninterference activities. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n1.  Immediate Post-Election Activity \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nAs  soon  as  news  broke  that  Trump  had  been  elected  President,  Russian  government \\nofficials  and  prominent  Russian  businessmen  began  trying  to  make  inroads  into  the  new \\nAdministration.  They appeared not to have preexisting contacts and struggled to connect with \\nsenior officials around the President-Elect.  As explained below, those efforts entailed both official \\n \\ncontact through the Russian Embassy in the United States and outreaches—sanctioned at high \\nlevels of the Russian government—through business rather than political contacts.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n\\n959  Manafort  (D.D.C.)

Outreach from the Russian Government \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nAt approximately 3 a.m. on election night, Trump Campaign press secretary Hope Hicks \\n \\nreceived a telephone call on her personal cell phone from a person who sounded foreign but was \\ncalling from a number with a DC area code.964  Although Hicks had a hard time understanding the \\n \\nperson, she could make out the words “Putin call.”965  Hicks told the caller to send her an email.966 \\n  \\n\\n \\n \\nThe following morning, on November 9, 2016, Sergey Kuznetsov, an official at the Russian \\n \\nEmbassy  to  the  United  States,  emailed  Hicks  from  his  Gmail  address  with  the  subject  line, \\n“Message from Putin.”967  Attached to the email was a message from Putin, in both English and \\nRussian, which Kuznetsov asked Hicks to convey to the President-Elect.968  In the message, Putin \\noffered  his  congratulations  to  Trump  for  his  electoral  victory,  stating  he “look[ed]  forward  to \\n   \\nworking with [Trump] on leading Russian-American relations out of crisis.”969 \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\nHicks forwarded the email to Kushner, asking, “Can you look into this? Don’t want to get \\nduped but don’t want to blow off Putin!”970  Kushner stated in Congressional testimony that he \\nbelieved that it would be possible to verify the authenticity of the forwarded email through the \\n \\nRussian Ambassador, whom Kushner had previously met in April 2016.971  Unable to recall the \\nRussian Ambassador’s name, Kushner emailed Dimitri Simes of CNI, whom he had consulted \\npreviously about Russia, see Volume I, Section IV.A.4, supra, and asked, “What is the name of \\nRussian  ambassador?”972  Kushner  forwarded  Simes’s  response—which  identified  Kislyak  by \\nname—to Hicks.973  After checking with Kushner to see what he had learned, Hicks conveyed \\nPutin’s letter to transition officials.974  Five days later, on November 14, 2016, Trump and Putin \\nspoke  by  phone  in  the  presence  of  Transition  Team  members,  including  incoming  National \\nSecurity Advisor Michael Flynn.975 \\n\\n  \\n \\n     \\n\\n   \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                                 \\n\\n964 Hicks 12/8/17 302, at 3. \\n \\n965 Hicks 12/8/17 302, at 3. \\n \\n966 Hicks 12/8/17 302, at 3. \\n \\n967 NOSC00044381 (11/9/16 Email, Kuznetsov to Hicks (5:27 a.m.)). \\n968 NOSC00044381-82 (11/9/16 Email, Kuznetsov to Hicks (5:27 a.m.)). \\n969  NOSC00044382  (11/9/16  Letter  from  Putin  to  President-Elect  Trump  (Nov.  9,  2016) \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(translation)). \\n\\n970 NOSC00044381 (11/9/16 Email, Hicks to Kushner (10:26 a.m.)). \\n971 Statement of Jared C.

Kirill Dmitriev’s Transition-Era Outreach to the Incoming Administration \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\nAven’s description of his interactions with Putin is consistent with the behavior of Kirill \\nDmitriev, a Russian national who heads Russia’s sovereign wealth fund and is closely connected \\nto Putin.  Dmitriev undertook efforts to meet members of the incoming Trump Administration in \\n \\nthe months after the election.  Dmitriev asked a close business associate who worked for the United \\nArab Emirates (UAE) royal court, George Nader, to introduce him to Trump transition officials, \\n \\nand Nader eventually arranged a meeting in the Seychelles between Dmitriev and Erik Prince, a \\nTrump Campaign supporter and an associate of Steve Bannon.989  In addition, the UAE national \\nsecurity advisor introduced Dmitriev to a hedge fund manager and friend of Jared Kushner, Rick \\nGerson,  in  late  November  2016.  In  December  2016  and  January  2017,  Dmitriev  and  Gerson \\n \\nworked on a proposal for reconciliation between the United States and Russia, which Dmitriev \\nimplied  he  cleared  through  Putin.  Gerson  provided  that  proposal  to  Kushner  before  the \\n \\ninauguration, and Kushner later gave copies to Bannon and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.   \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\na.

Kushner told the Office that the meeting was diplomatic, with Gorkov \\nexpressing  disappointment  with  U.S.-Russia  relations  under  President  Obama  and  hopes  for \\nimproved relations with the incoming Administration.1157  According to Kushner, although Gorkov \\n \\ntold Kushner a little bit about his bank and made some statements about the Russian economy, the \\n \\ntwo did not discuss Kushner’s companies or private business dealings of any kind.1158  (At the time \\nof the meeting, Kushner Companies had a debt obligation coming due on the building it owned at \\n666 Fifth Avenue, and there had been public reporting both about efforts to secure lending on the \\nproperty and possible conflicts of interest for Kushner arising out of his company’s borrowing \\nfrom foreign lenders.1159) \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nIn  contrast,  in  a  2017  public  statement,  VEB  suggested  Gorkov  met  with  Kushner  in \\nKushner’s capacity as CEO of Kushner Companies for the purpose of discussing business, rather \\nthan  as  part  of  a  diplomatic  effort.  In  particular,  VEB  characterized  Gorkov’s  meeting  with \\nKushner as part of a series of “roadshow meetings” with “representatives of major US banks and \\n \\nbusiness circles,” which included “negotiations” and discussion of the “most promising business \\n  \\nlines and sectors.”1160 \\n\\n \\nForesman, the investment bank executive mentioned in Volume I, Sections IV.A.1 and \\n \\nIV.B.3,  supra,  told  the  Office  that  he  met  with  Gorkov  and  VEB  deputy  chairman  Nikolay \\nTsekhomsky in Moscow just before Gorkov left for New York to meet Kushner.1161  According to \\nForesman, Gorkov and Tsekhomsky told him that they were traveling to New York to discuss post-\\nelection issues with U.S. financial institutions, that their trip was sanctioned by Putin, and that they \\nwould be reporting back to Putin upon their return.1162 \\n \\n\\n \\n       \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                                 \\n\\n1155  Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 19.

Aven  instructed  Richard  Burt  to  make  contact  with  the  incoming  Trump \\nAdministration.

Contacts With and Through Michael T. Flynn  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n \\nIncoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn was the Transition Team’s primary \\nconduit for communications with the Russian Ambassador and dealt with Russia on two sensitive \\nmatters during the transition period:  a United Nations Security Council vote and the Russian \\ngovernment’s reaction to the United States’s imposition of sanctions for Russian interference in \\n \\nthe 2016 election.1207  Despite Kushner’s conclusion that Kislyak did not wield influence inside \\nthe  Russian  government,  the  Transition  Team  turned  to  Flynn’s  relationship  with  Kislyak  on \\nboth issues.  As to the sanctions, Flynn spoke by phone to K.T. McFarland, his incoming deputy, \\nto  prepare  for  his  call  to  Kislyak;  McFarland  was  with  the  President-Elect  and  other  senior \\nmembers of the Transition Team at Mar-a-Lago at the time.  Although transition officials at Mar-\\na-Lago had some concern about possible Russian reactions to the sanctions, the investigation did \\nnot identify evidence that the President-Elect asked Flynn to make any request to Kislyak.  Flynn \\nasked Kislyak not to escalate the situation in response to U.S. sanctions imposed on December 29, \\n2016, and Kislyak later reported to Flynn that Russia acceded to that request.   \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\na.

PROSECUTION AND DECLINATION DECISIONS \\n \\n \\n \\nThe  Appointment  Order  authorized  the  Special  Counsel’s  Office  “to  prosecute  federal \\n \\ncrimes  arising  from  [its]  investigation”  of  the  matters  assigned  to  it.    In  deciding  whether  to \\nexercise  this  prosecutorial  authority,  the  Office  has  been  guided  by  the  Principles  of  Federal \\nProsecution set forth in the Justice (formerly U.S. Attorney’s) Manual.  In particular, the Office \\n \\nhas  evaluated  whether  the  conduct  of  the  individuals  considered for  prosecution  constituted  a \\nfederal offense and whether admissible evidence would probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain \\na conviction for such an offense.  Justice Manual § 9-27.220 (2018).  Where the answer to those \\nquestions was yes, the Office further considered whether the prosecution would serve a substantial \\nfederal interest, the individuals were subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction, and \\nthere existed an adequate non-criminal alternative to prosecution.  Id. \\n \\n \\nAs explained below, those considerations led the Office to seek charges against two sets of \\nRussian nationals for their roles in perpetrating the active-measures social media campaign and \\n \\ncomputer-intrusion operations.   \\n \\n    The  Office \\nsimilarly determined that the contacts  between Campaign officials and Russia-linked individuals  \\neither  did  not  involve  the  commission  of  a  federal  crime  or,  in  the  case  of  campaign-finance \\n \\noffenses, that our evidence was not sufficient to obtain and sustain a criminal conviction.  At the \\nsame time, the Office concluded that the Principles of Federal Prosecution supported charging \\n \\ncertain  individuals  connected  to  the  Campaign  with  making  false  statements  or  otherwise \\nobstructing this investigation or parallel congressional investigations.   \\n \\n\\n    \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nA.  Russian “Active Measures” Social Media Campaign \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nOn  February  16,  2018,  a  federal  grand  jury  in  the  District  of  Columbia  returned  an \\n \\nindictment  charging  13  Russian  nationals  and  three  Russian  entities—including  the  Internet \\nResearch  Agency  (IRA)  and  Concord  Management  and  Consulting  LLC  (Concord)—with \\n  \\nviolating U.S. criminal laws in order to interfere with U.S. elections and political processes.1276 \\nThe indictment charges all of the defendants with conspiracy to defraud the United States (Count \\nOne), three defendants with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud (Count Two), and \\nfive defendants with aggravated identity theft (Counts Three through Eight).  Internet Research \\nAgency Indictment.  Concord, which is one of the entities charged in the Count One conspiracy, \\nentered an appearance through U.S. counsel and moved to dismiss the charge on multiple grounds.  \\nIn orders and memorandum opinions issued on August 13 and November 15, 2018, the district \\ncourt denied Concord’s motions to dismiss.  United States v. Concord Management & Consulting \\n \\nLLC, 347 F. Supp. 3d 38 (D.D.C. 2018). United States v. Concord Management & Consulting \\nLLC, 317 F. Supp. 3d 598 (D.D.C. 2018). As of this writing, the prosecution of Concord remains \\nongoing before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

That is because the investigation did not identify evidence \\n \\n \\nthat any U.S. person who coordinated or communicated with the IRA knew that he or she was \\nspeaking  with  Russian  nationals  engaged  in  the  criminal  conspiracy.  The  Office  therefore \\ndetermined that such persons did not have the knowledge or criminal purpose required to charge \\n \\nthem in the conspiracy to defraud the United States (Count One) or in the separate count alleging \\na wire- and bank-fraud conspiracy involving the IRA and two individual Russian nationals (Count \\nTwo). \\n \\nThe Office did, however, charge one U.S. national for his role in supplying false or stolen \\n \\n \\nbank account numbers that allowed the IRA conspirators to access U.S. online payment systems \\nby circumventing those systems’ security features.  On February 12, 2018, Richard Pinedo pleaded \\nguilty,  pursuant  to  a  single-count  information,  to  identity  fraud,  in  violation  of  18  U.S.C. \\n§ 1028(a)(7) and (b)(1)(D).  Plea Agreement, United States v. Richard Pinedo, No. 1:18-cr-24 \\n(D.D.C. Feb. 12, 2018), Doc. 10.  The investigation did not establish that Pinedo was aware of the \\nidentity of the IRA members who purchased bank account numbers from him.  Pinedo’s sales of \\naccount numbers enabled the IRA members to anonymously access a financial network through \\nwhich they transacted with U.S. persons and companies.  See Gov’t Sent.

The  statutes  comprising  the  NSPA  cover \\n \\n“goods, wares, or merchandise,” and lower courts have largely understood that phrase to be limited to \\ntangible items since the Supreme Court’s decision in Dowling v. United States, 473 U.S. 207 (1985).  See \\nUnited States v. Yijia Zhang, 995 F. Supp. 2d 340, 344-48 (E.D. Pa. 2014) (collecting cases).  One of those \\n \\npost-Dowling decisions—United States v. Brown, 925 F.2d 1301 (10th Cir. 1991)—specifically held that \\n \\nthe NSPA does not reach “a computer program in source code form,” even though that code was stored in \\ntangible items (i.e., a hard disk and in a three-ring notebook).  Id. at 1302-03.  Congress, in turn, cited the \\nBrown opinion in explaining the need for amendments to 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(2) that “would ensure that \\nthe theft of intangible information by the unauthorized use of a computer is prohibited in the same way theft \\nof physical items [is] protected.”  S. Rep. 104-357, at 7 (1996).  That sequence of events would make it \\ndifficult to argue that hacked emails in electronic form, which are the relevant stolen items here, constitute \\n \\n“goods, wares, or merchandise” within the meaning of the NSPA. \\n\\n   \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n176 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

Russian Government Outreach and Contacts \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\nAs  explained  in  Section  IV  above,  the  Office’s  investigation  uncovered  evidence  of \\nnumerous  links  (i.e.,  contacts)  between  Trump  Campaign  officials  and  individuals  having  or \\nclaiming to have ties to the Russian government.  The Office evaluated the contacts under several \\nsets of federal laws, including conspiracy laws and statutes governing foreign agents who operate \\nin the United States.  After considering the available evidence, the Office did not pursue charges \\nunder  these  statutes  against  any  of  the  individuals  discussed  in  Section  IV  above—with  the \\nexception of FARA charges against Paul Manafort and Richard Gates based on their activities on \\n \\nbehalf of Ukraine. \\n \\nOne of the interactions between the Trump Campaign and Russian-affiliated individuals— \\n \\nthe  June  9,  2016  meeting  between  high-ranking  campaign  officials  and  Russians  promising \\nderogatory  information  on  Hillary  Clinton—implicates  an  additional  body  of  law:  campaign-\\nfinance statutes.  Schemes involving the solicitation or receipt of assistance from foreign sources \\nraise difficult statutory and constitutional questions.  As explained  below, the Office evaluated  \\n  \\nthose questions in connection with the June 9 meeting \\n. \\nThe Office ultimately concluded that, even if  the principal legal questions were resolved favorably \\nto the government, a prosecution would encounter difficulties proving that Campaign officials or \\nindividuals connected to the Campaign willfully violated the law.    \\n \\n \\nFinally,  although  the  evidence  of  contacts  between  Campaign  officials  and  Russia-\\naffiliated individuals may not have been sufficient to establish or sustain criminal charges, several \\nU.S. persons connected to the Campaign made false statements about those contacts and took other \\nsteps  to  obstruct  the  Office’s  investigation  and  those  of  Congress.  This  Office  has  therefore \\ncharged some of those individuals with making false statements and obstructing justice.   \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1.  Potential Coordination: Conspiracy and Collusion \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\nAs an initial matter, this Office evaluated potentially criminal conduct that involved the \\ncollective action of multiple individuals not under the rubric of “collusion,” but through the lens \\nof conspiracy law.  In so doing, the Office recognized that the word “collud[e]” appears in the \\nActing Attorney General’s August 2, 2017 memorandum; it has frequently been invoked in public \\nreporting; and it is sometimes referenced in antitrust law, see, e.g., Brooke Group v. Brown & \\n \\nWilliamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 227 (1993).  But collusion is not a specific offense or \\n \\ntheory of liability found in the U.S. Code; nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law.  To the \\n \\ncontrary, even as defined in legal dictionaries, collusion is largely synonymous with conspiracy as \\nthat crime is set forth in the general federal conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. § 371.  See Black’s Law \\nDictionary 321 (10th ed. 2014) (collusion is “[a]n agreement to defraud another or to do or obtain \\nsomething forbidden by law”); 1 Alexander Burrill, A Law Dictionary and Glossary 311 (1871) \\n(“An agreement between two or more persons to defraud another by the forms of law, or to employ \\nsuch forms as means of accomplishing some unlawful object.”); 1 Bouvier’s Law Dictionary 352 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n180 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

The investigation did not establish that the contacts described in Volume \\n \\nI, Section IV, supra, amounted to an agreement to commit any substantive violation of federal \\ncriminal  law—including  foreign-influence  and  campaign-finance  laws,  both  of  which  are \\ndiscussed further below.  The Office therefore did not charge any individual associated with the \\nTrump Campaign with conspiracy to commit a federal offense arising from Russia contacts, either \\nunder a specific statute or under Section 371’s offenses clause.  \\n \\n\\nThe Office also did not charge any campaign official or associate with a conspiracy under \\nSection 371’s defraud clause.  That clause criminalizes participating in an agreement to obstruct a \\nlawful function of the U.S. government or its agencies through deceitful or dishonest means.  See \\nDennis v. United States, 384 U.S. 855, 861 (1966); Hammerschmidt v. United States, 265 U.S. \\n182, 188 (1924); see also United States v. Concord Mgmt. & Consulting LLC, 347 F. Supp. 3d 38, \\n46 (D.D.C. 2018).  The investigation did not establish any agreement among Campaign officials— \\nor between such officials and Russia-linked individuals—to interfere with or obstruct a lawful \\nfunction of a government agency during the campaign or transition period.  And, as discussed in \\nVolume  I,  Section  V.A,  supra,  the  investigation  did  not  identify  evidence  that  any  Campaign \\n \\nofficial or associate knowingly and intentionally participated in the conspiracy to defraud that the \\nOffice charged, namely, the active-measures conspiracy described in Volume I, Section II, supra. \\nAccordingly,  the  Office  did  not  charge  any  Campaign  associate  or  other  U.S.  person  with \\nconspiracy to defraud the United States based on the Russia-related contacts described in Section \\n \\nIV above. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n2.  Potential Coordination: Foreign Agent Statutes (FARA and 18 U.S.C. § 951) \\n\\n \\n\\nThe Office next assessed the potential liability of Campaign-affiliated individuals under \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nfederal statutes regulating actions on behalf of, or work done for, a foreign government.   \\n \\n\\na.  Governing Law \\n\\n \\nUnder 18 U.S.C. § 951, it is generally illegal to act in the United States as an agent of a \\nforeign government without providing notice to the Attorney General.  Although the defendant \\nmust act on behalf of a foreign government (as opposed to other kinds of foreign entities), the acts \\nneed not involve espionage; rather, acts of any type suffice for liability.  See United States v. \\nDuran, 596 F.3d 1283, 1293-94 (11th Cir. 2010); United States v. Latchin, 554 F.3d 709, 715 (7th \\nCir. 2009); United States v. Dumeisi, 424 F.3d 566, 581 (7th Cir. 2005).  An “agent of a foreign \\ngovernment”  is  an  “individual”  who  “agrees  to  operate”  in  the  United  States  “subject  to  the \\n \\ndirection or control of a foreign government or official.”  18 U.S.C. § 951(d). \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n181 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

The statute does not require \\nwillfulness, and knowledge of the notification requirement is not an element of the offense.  United \\n \\nStates v. Campa, 529 F.3d 980, 998-99 (11th Cir. 2008); Duran, 596 F.3d at 1291-94; Dumeisi, \\n424 F.3d at 581. \\n \\n\\nThe Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) generally makes it illegal to act as an agent \\nof  a  foreign  principal  by  engaging  in  certain  (largely  political)  activities  in  the  United  States \\nwithout registering with the Attorney General.  22 U.S.C. §§ 611-621.  The triggering agency \\nrelationship must be with a foreign principal or “a person any of whose activities are directly or \\nindirectly supervised, directed, controlled, financed, or subsidized in whole or in major part by a \\nforeign principal.”  22 U.S.C. § 611(c)(1).  That includes a foreign government or political party \\nand various foreign individuals and entities.  22 U.S.C. § 611(b).  A covered relationship exists if \\na person “acts as an agent, representative, employee, or servant” or “in any other capacity at the \\n \\norder, request, or under the [foreign principal’s] direction or control.”  22 U.S.C. § 611(c)(1).  It \\nis sufficient if the person “agrees, consents, assumes or purports to act as, or who is or holds \\n \\nhimself  out  to  be,  whether  or  not  pursuant  to  contractual  relationship,  an  agent  of  a  foreign \\nprincipal.”  22 U.S.C. § 611(c)(2). \\n \\n\\nThe triggering activity is that the agent “directly or through any other person” in the United \\nStates (1) engages in “political activities for or in the interests of [the] foreign principal,” which \\n \\nincludes attempts to influence federal officials or the public; (2) acts as “public relations counsel, \\npublicity agent, information-service employee or political consultant for or in the interests of such \\n \\nforeign principal”; (3) “solicits, collects, disburses, or dispenses contributions, loans, money, or \\n \\nother things of value for or in the interest of such foreign principal”; or (4) “represents the interests \\nof such foreign principal” before any federal agency or official.  22 U.S.C. § 611(c)(1). \\n \\n\\nIt is a crime to engage in a “[w]illful violation of any provision of the Act or any regulation \\nthereunder.”  22  U.S.C.  § 618(a)(1).  It  is  also  a  crime  willfully  to  make  false  statements  or \\nomissions  of  material  facts  in  FARA  registration  statements  or  supplements.  22  U.S.C. \\n§ 618(a)(2). Most violations have a maximum penalty of five years of imprisonment and a $10,000 \\nfine.  22 U.S.C. § 618. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nb.  Application \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nThe investigation uncovered extensive evidence that Paul Manafort’s and Richard Gates’s \\npre-campaign work for the government of Ukraine violated FARA.  Manafort and Gates were \\ncharged  for  that  conduct  and  admitted  to  it  when  they  pleaded  guilty  to  superseding  criminal \\ninformations in the District of Columbia prosecution.1280  The evidence underlying those charges \\nis not addressed in this report because it was discussed in public court documents and in a separate \\n                                                 \\n\\n1280  Gates Superseding Criminal Information; Waiver of Indictment, United States v.

Those potential violations, however, concerned a country other than Russia (i.e., Turkey) \\n \\nand were resolved when Flynn admitted to the underlying facts in the Statement of Offense that \\naccompanied his guilty plea to a false-statements charge.

Dec.  1,  2017),  Doc.  4  (“Flynn  Statement  of \\nOffense”).1281 \\n\\n      \\n\\n \\nThe investigation did not, however, yield evidence sufficient to sustain any charge that any \\n \\nindividual affiliated with the Trump Campaign acted as an agent of a foreign principal within the \\nmeaning of FARA or, in terms of Section 951, subject to the direction or control of the government \\n \\nof Russia, or any official thereof.  In particular, the Office did not find evidence likely to prove \\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Campaign officials such as Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos, \\nand  Carter  Page  acted  as  agents  of  the  Russian  government—or  at  its  direction,  control,  or \\n \\nrequest—during the relevant time period.1282\\n \\n  \\nAs a result, the Office did not charge PP \\n \\nany other Trump Campaign official with violating \\n \\nFARA or Section 951, or attempting or conspiring to do so, based on contacts with the Russian \\ngovernment or a Russian principal. \\n\\n Personal Privacy\\n\\n \\nFinally,  the  Office  investigated  whether  one  of  the  above  campaign  advisors—George \\nPapadopoulos—acted as an agent of, or at the direction and control of, the government of Israel.  \\nWhile  the  investigation revealed  significant ties  between  Papadopoulos  and  Israel (and  search \\nwarrants were obtained in part on that basis), the Office ultimately determined that the evidence \\nwas not sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction under FARA or Section 951.    \\n \\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n3.  Campaign Finance \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\nSeveral areas of the Office’s investigation involved efforts or offers by foreign nationals to \\nprovide negative information about candidate Clinton to the Trump Campaign or to distribute that \\n \\ninformation to the public, to the anticipated benefit of the Campaign.  As explained below, the \\n \\nOffice considered whether two of those efforts in particular—the June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump \\n                                                 \\n\\n \\n\\n1281 \\n \\n\\n     \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1282  On four occasions, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) issued warrants based \\non a finding of probable cause to believe that Page was an agent of a foreign power.  50 U.S.C. §§ 1801(b), \\n \\n1805(a)(2)(A).  The FISC’s probable-cause finding was based on a different (and lower) standard than the \\n \\none governing the Office’s decision whether to bring charges against Page, which is whether admissible \\nevidence would likely be sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Page acted as an agent of the \\n \\nRussian Federation during the period at issue.  Cf. United States v. Cardoza, 713 F.3d 656, 660 (D.C. Cir. \\n2013) (explaining that probable cause requires only “a fair probability,” and not “certainty, or proof beyond \\n \\na reasonable doubt, or proof by a preponderance of the evidence”).       \\n  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n183 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

The  Office determined that the evidence was  not sufficient to charge \\neither incident as a criminal violation.   \\n \\n\\na.  Overview Of Governing Law \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n“[T]he United States has a compelling interest . . .  in limiting the participation of foreign \\n \\ncitizens in activities of democratic self-government, and in thereby preventing foreign influence \\nover  the  U.S.  political  process.”  Bluman  v.  FEC,  800  F.  Supp.  2d  281,  288  (D.D.C.  2011) \\n \\n(Kavanaugh, J., for three-judge court), aff’d, 565 U.S. 1104 (2012).  To that end, federal campaign-\\nfinance  law  broadly  prohibits  foreign  nationals  from  making  contributions,  donations, \\n \\nexpenditures, or other disbursements in connection with federal, state, or local candidate elections, \\nand prohibits anyone from soliciting, accepting, or receiving such contributions or donations.  As \\nrelevant here, foreign nationals may not make—and no one may “solicit, accept, or receive” from \\nthem—“a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value” or “an express or implied \\npromise to make a contribution or donation, in connection with a Federal, State, or local election.”  \\n52 U.S.C. § 30121(a)(1)(A), (a)(2).1283  The term “contribution,” which is used throughout the \\ncampaign-finance law, “includes” “any gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or \\nanything of value made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal \\n \\noffice.”  52 U.S.C. § 30101(8)(A)(i).  It excludes, among other things, “the value of [volunteer] \\nservices.”  52 U.S.C. § 30101(8)(B)(i). \\n \\n \\nForeign nationals are also barred from making “an expenditure, independent expenditure, \\n \\nor disbursement for an electioneering communication.”  52 U.S.C. § 30121(a)(1)(C).  The term \\n“expenditure” “includes” “any purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of \\n \\nmoney or anything of value, made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for \\nFederal office.”  52 U.S.C. § 30101(9)(A)(i).  It excludes, among other things, news stories and \\nnon-partisan  get-out-the-vote  activities.  52  U.S.C.  § 30101(9)(B)(i)-(ii).  An  “independent \\nexpenditure” is an expenditure “expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified \\ncandidate” and made independently of the campaign.  52 U.S.C. § 30101(17).  An “electioneering \\ncommunication” is a broadcast communication that “refers to a clearly identified candidate for \\n \\nFederal office” and is made within specified time periods and targeted at the relevant electorate.  \\n52 U.S.C. § 30104(f)(3). \\n \\n \\nThe  statute  defines  “foreign  national”  by  reference  to  FARA  and  the  Immigration  and \\nNationality Act, with minor modification.  52 U.S.C. § 30121(b) (cross-referencing 22 U.S.C. \\n§ 611(b)(1)-(3)  and  8  U.S.C.  §  1101(a)(20),  (22)).  That  definition  yields  five,  sometimes-\\noverlapping  categories  of  foreign  nationals,  which  include  all  of  the  individuals  and  entities \\nrelevant  for  present  purposes—namely,  foreign  governments  and  political  parties,  individuals \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                                 \\n\\n1283 Campaign-finance law also places financial limits on contributions, 52 U.S.C. § 30116(a), and \\n \\nprohibits contributions from corporations, banks, and labor unions, 52 U.S.C. § 30118(a); see Citizens \\n \\n \\nUnited  v.  FEC,  558  U.S.  310,  320  (2010).  Because  the  conduct  that  the  Office  investigated  involved \\npossible electoral activity by foreign nationals, the foreign-contributions ban is the most readily applicable \\nprovision. \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n184 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

Application to June 9 Trump Tower Meeting \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nThe  Office  considered  whether  to  charge  Trump  Campaign  officials  with  crimes  in \\n \\nconnection with the June 9 meeting described in Volume I, Section IV.A.5, supra. The Office \\n \\nconcluded  that,  in  light  of  the  government’s  substantial  burden  of  proof  on  issues  of  intent \\n \\n(“knowing” and “willful”), and the difficulty of establishing the value of the offered information, \\ncriminal charges would not meet the Justice Manual standard that “the admissible evidence will \\nprobably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction.”  Justice Manual § 9-27.220.  \\n \\n\\nIn brief, the key facts are that, on June 3, 2016, Robert Goldstone emailed Donald Trump \\n \\nJr., to pass along from Emin and Aras Agalarov an “offer” from Russia’s “Crown prosecutor” to \\n \\n“the Trump campaign” of “official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and \\nher dealings with Russia and would be very useful to [Trump Jr.’s] father.”  The email described \\nthis as “very high level and sensitive information” that is “part of Russia and its government’s \\nsupport to Mr. Trump-helped along by Aras and Emin.”  Trump Jr. responded: “if it’s what you \\nsay  I  love  it  especially  later  in  the  summer.”    Trump  Jr.  and  Emin  Agalarov  had  follow-up \\nconversations  and,  within  days,  scheduled  a  meeting  with  Russian  representatives  that  was \\nattended by Trump Jr., Manafort, and Kushner.  The communications setting up the meeting and \\nthe attendance by high-level Campaign representatives support an inference that the Campaign \\nanticipated receiving derogatory documents and information from official Russian sources that \\ncould assist candidate Trump’s electoral prospects.   \\n \\n \\nThis series of events could implicate the federal election-law ban on contributions and \\n \\ndonations by foreign nationals, 52 U.S.C. § 30121(a)(1)(A).  Specifically, Goldstone passed along \\nan  offer  purportedly  from  a  Russian  government  official  to  provide  “official  documents  and \\n  \\ninformation” to the Trump Campaign for the purposes of influencing the presidential election. \\nTrump Jr. appears to have accepted that offer and to have arranged a meeting to receive those \\nmaterials.  Documentary evidence in the form of email chains supports the inference that Kushner \\nand Manafort were aware of that purpose and attended the June 9 meeting anticipating the receipt \\nof helpful information to the Campaign from Russian sources.   \\n \\n\\nThe Office considered whether this evidence would establish a conspiracy to violate the \\nforeign contributions ban, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; the solicitation of an illegal foreign-\\nsource contribution; or the acceptance or receipt of “an express or implied promise to make a \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n185 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

There are \\nreasonable arguments that the offered information would constitute a “thing of value” within the \\nmeaning of these provisions, but the Office determined that the government would not be likely to \\nobtain and sustain a conviction for two other reasons:  first, the Office did not obtain admissible \\nevidence likely to meet the government’s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that these \\nindividuals acted “willfully,” i.e., with general knowledge of the illegality of their conduct; and, \\nsecond, the government would likely encounter difficulty in proving beyond a reasonable doubt \\nthat the value of the promised information exceeded the threshold for a criminal violation, see 52 \\nU.S.C. § 30109(d)(1)(A)(i). \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\ni.  Thing-of-Value Element \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nA  threshold  legal  question  is  whether  providing  to  a  campaign  “documents  and \\n \\ninformation” of the type involved here would constitute a prohibited campaign contribution.  The \\n \\nforeign  contribution  ban  is  not  limited  to  contributions  of  money.  It  expressly  prohibits  “a \\ncontribution or donation of money or other thing of value.” 52 U.S.C. § 30121(a)(1)(A), (a)(2) \\n \\n(emphasis added).  And the term “contribution” is defined throughout the campaign-finance laws \\nto “include[]” “any gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value.” \\n52 U.S.C. § 30101(8)(A)(i) (emphasis added).   \\n \\nThe phrases “thing of value” and “anything of value” are broad and inclusive enough to \\n \\nencompass at least some forms of valuable information.  Throughout the United States Code, these \\nphrases serve as “term[s] of art” that are construed “broad[ly].”  United States v. Nilsen, 967 F.2d \\n539, 542 (11th Cir. 1992) (per curiam) (“thing of value” includes “both tangibles and intangibles”); \\nsee also, e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 201(b)(1), 666(a)(2) (bribery statutes); id. § 641 (theft of government \\n \\nproperty).  For  example,  the  term  “thing  of  value”  encompasses law  enforcement  reports  that \\nwould reveal the identity of informants, United States v. Girard, 601 F.2d 69, 71 (2d Cir. 1979); \\nclassified  materials,  United  States  v.

The FEC has concluded that the phrase includes a state-by-state list of \\n \\nactivists.  See Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. FEC, 475 F.3d 337, 338 \\n(D.C. Cir. 2007) (describing the FEC’s findings).

And in the specific context of the foreign-contributions ban, the FEC has \\nconcluded  that  “election  materials  used  in  previous  Canadian  campaigns,”  including  “flyers, \\nadvertisements, door hangers, tri-folds, signs, and other printed material,” constitute “anything of \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n186 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

A campaign can be assisted not only by the provision of funds, \\nbut  also  by  the  provision  of  derogatory  information  about  an  opponent.  Political  campaigns \\n \\nfrequently conduct and pay for opposition research.   A foreign entity that engaged in such research \\nand provided resulting information to a campaign could exert a greater effect on an election, and \\na greater tendency to ingratiate the donor to the candidate, than a gift of money or tangible things \\nof  value.  At  the  same  time,  no  judicial  decision  has  treated  the  voluntary  provision  of \\nuncompensated opposition research or similar information as a thing of value that could amount \\n \\nto a contribution under campaign-finance law.  Such an interpretation could have implications \\nbeyond the foreign-source ban, see 52 U.S.C. § 30116(a) (imposing monetary limits on campaign \\ncontributions), and raise First Amendment questions.  Those questions could be especially difficult \\nwhere  the  information  consisted  simply  of  the  recounting  of  historically  accurate  facts.  It  is \\n \\nuncertain how courts would resolve those issues.     \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nii.

Most significantly, the \\ngovernment has not obtained admissible evidence that is likely to establish the scienter requirement \\nbeyond  a  reasonable  doubt.  To  prove  that  a  defendant  acted  “knowingly  and  willfully,”  the \\ngovernment would have to show that the defendant had general knowledge that his conduct was \\n \\nunlawful.  U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses 123 (8th ed. Dec. \\n2017) (“Election Offenses”); see Bluman, 800 F. Supp. 2d at 292 (noting that a willful violation \\nrequires “proof of the defendant’s knowledge of the law”); Danielczyk, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 577 \\n(“knowledge  of  general  unlawfulness”).  “This  standard  creates  an  elevated  scienter  element \\nrequiring, at the very least, that application of the law to the facts in question be fairly clear.  When \\nthere is substantial doubt concerning whether the law applies to the facts of a particular matter, the \\n \\noffender is more likely to have an intent defense.”  Election Offenses 123. \\n \\n\\nOn the facts here, the government would unlikely be able to prove beyond a reasonable \\ndoubt that the June 9 meeting participants had general knowledge that their conduct was unlawful.  \\nThe investigation has not developed evidence that the participants in the meeting were familiar \\nwith the foreign-contribution ban or the application of federal law to the relevant factual context.  \\nThe government does not have strong evidence of surreptitious behavior or efforts at concealment \\nat the time of the June 9 meeting.  While the government has evidence of later efforts to prevent \\n \\ndisclosure of the nature of the June 9 meeting that could circumstantially provide support for a \\nshowing of scienter, see Volume II, Section II.G, infra, that concealment occurred more than a \\nyear later, involved individuals who did not attend the June 9 meeting, and may reflect an intention \\nto avoid political consequences rather than any prior knowledge of illegality.  Additionally, in light \\n \\nof the unresolved legal questions about whether giving “documents and information” of the sort \\noffered here constitutes a campaign contribution, Trump Jr. could mount a factual defense that he \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n187 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe Office would also encounter difficulty proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the \\nvalue of the promised documents and information exceeds the $2,000 threshold for a criminal \\n \\nviolation, as well as the $25,000 threshold for felony punishment.  See 52 U.S.C. § 30109(d)(1).  \\nThe type of evidence commonly used to establish the value of non-monetary contributions—such \\nas pricing the contribution on a commercial market or determining the upstream acquisition cost \\nor  the  cost  of  distribution—would  likely  be  unavailable  or  ineffective  in  this  factual  setting. \\nAlthough  damaging  opposition  research  is  surely  valuable  to  a  campaign,  it  appears  that  the \\ninformation ultimately delivered in the meeting was not valuable.  And while value in a conspiracy \\nmay well be measured by what the participants expected to receive at the time of the agreement, \\n \\nsee, e.g., United States v. Tombrello, 666 F.2d 485, 489 (11th Cir. 1982), Goldstone’s description \\nof the offered material here was quite general.  His suggestion of the information’s value—i.e., \\n \\nthat it would “incriminate Hillary” and “would be very useful to [Trump Jr.’s] father”—was non-\\nspecific  and  may  have  been  understood  as  being  of  uncertain  worth  or  reliability,  given \\nGoldstone’s lack of direct access to the original source.  The uncertainty over what would be \\ndelivered could be reflected in Trump Jr.’s response (“if it’s what you say I love it”) (emphasis \\n \\nadded). \\n \\nAccordingly, taking into account the high burden to establish a culpable mental state in a \\n \\ncampaign-finance prosecution and the difficulty in establishing the required valuation, the Office \\ndecided not to pursue criminal campaign-finance charges against Trump Jr. or other campaign \\n \\nofficials for the events culminating in the June 9 meeting.   \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nc.  Application to \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n   \\n\\ndid not believe his response to the offer and the June 9 meeting itself violated the law.  Given his \\nless direct involvement in arranging the June 9 meeting, Kushner could likely mount a similar \\ndefense.  And,  while  Manafort  is  experienced  with  political  campaigns,  the  Office  has  not \\n \\ndeveloped evidence showing that he had relevant knowledge of these legal issues.  \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\niii.

False Statements and Obstruction of the Investigation \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\nThe  Office  determined  that  certain  individuals  associated  with  the  Campaign  lied  to \\n \\ninvestigators about Campaign contacts with Russia and have taken other actions to interfere with \\nthe investigation.  As explained below, the Office therefore charged some U.S. persons connected \\nto the Campaign with false statements and obstruction offenses. \\n \\n\\n    \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\na.  Overview Of Governing Law \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nFalse  Statements.  The  principal  federal  statute  criminalizing  false  statements  to \\n \\ngovernment investigators is 18 U.S.C. § 1001.  As relevant here, under Section 1001(a)(2), it is a \\ncrime to knowingly and willfully “make[] any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement \\nor  representation”  “in  any  matter  within  the  jurisdiction  of  the  executive  .  .  .  branch  of  the \\nGovernment.”  An FBI investigation is a matter within the Executive Branch’s jurisdiction.  United \\n \\n \\nStates v. Rodgers, 466 U.S. 475, 479 (1984).  The statute also applies to a subset of legislative \\nbranch actions—viz., administrative matters and “investigation[s] or review[s]” conducted by a \\ncongressional committee or subcommittee.  18 U.S.C. § 1001(c)(1) and (2); see United States v. \\nPickett, 353 F.3d 62, 66 (D.C. Cir. 2004). \\n \\n\\nWhether the statement was made to law enforcement or congressional investigators, the \\ngovernment must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the same basic non-jurisdictional elements:  \\nthe statement was false, fictitious, or fraudulent; the defendant knew both that it was false and that \\nit was unlawful to make a false statement; and the false statement was material.  See, e.g., United \\nStates v. Smith, 831 F.3d 1207, 1222 n.27 (9th Cir. 2017) (listing elements); see also Ninth Circuit \\nPattern Instruction 8.73 & cmt. (explaining that the Section 1001 jury instruction was modified in \\nlight of the Department of Justice’s position that the phrase “knowingly and willfully” in the statute \\nrequires the defendant’s knowledge that his or her conduct was unlawful).  In the D.C. Circuit, the \\ngovernment must prove that the statement was actually false; a statement that is misleading but \\n“literally true” does not satisfy Section 1001(a)(2).  See United States v. Milton, 8 F.3d 39, 45 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n191 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

Dale, 991 F.2d 819, 832-33 & n.22 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  For that \\nfalse statement to qualify as “material,” it must have a natural tendency to influence, or be capable \\nof influencing, a discrete decision or any other function of the agency to which it is addressed.  See \\nUnited States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509 (1995); United States v. Moore, 612 F.3d 698, 701 \\n(D.C. Cir. 2010). \\n\\n \\nPerjury.  Under the federal perjury statutes, it is a crime for a witness testifying under oath \\nbefore a grand jury to knowingly make any false material declaration.  See 18 U.S.C. § 1623.  The \\n \\ngovernment must prove four elements beyond a reasonable doubt to obtain a conviction under \\nSection 1623(a):  the defendant testified under oath before a federal grand jury; the defendant’s \\ntestimony  was  false  in  one  or  more  respects;  the  false  testimony  concerned  matters  that  were \\nmaterial to the grand jury investigation; and the false testimony was knowingly given.  United \\nStates v. Bridges, 717 F.2d 1444, 1449 n.30 (D.C. Cir. 1983).  The general perjury statute, 18 \\n \\nU.S.C. § 1621, also applies to grand jury testimony and has similar elements, except that it requires \\n \\nthat  the  witness  have  acted  willfully  and  that  the  government  satisfy  “strict  common-law \\nrequirements for establishing falsity.”  See Dunn v. United States, 442 U.S. 100, 106 & n.6 (1979) \\n(explaining “the two-witness rule” and the corroboration that it demands).            \\n \\n\\nObstruction  of  Justice.  Three  basic  elements  are  common  to  the  obstruction  statutes \\npertinent to this Office’s charging decisions:  an obstructive act; some form of nexus between the \\n \\nobstructive act and an official proceeding; and criminal (i.e., corrupt) intent.  A detailed discussion \\nof those elements, and the law governing obstruction of justice more generally, is included in \\nVolume II of the report.   \\n   \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nb.  Application to Certain Individuals \\n\\ni.  George Papadopoulos \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nInvestigators approached Papadopoulos for an interview based on his role as a foreign \\n \\npolicy advisor to the Trump Campaign and his suggestion to a foreign government representative \\nthat  Russia had  indicated  that  it  could  assist  the  Campaign  through  the  anonymous  release  of \\ninformation damaging to candidate Clinton.  On January 27, 2017, Papadopoulos agreed to be \\ninterviewed by FBI agents, who informed him that the interview was part of the investigation into \\n \\n \\npotential Russian government interference in the 2016 presidential election.  \\n\\n \\nDuring  the  interview,  Papadopoulos  lied  about  the  timing,  extent,  and  nature  of  his \\ncommunications  with  Joseph  Mifsud,  Olga  Polonskaya,  and  Ivan  Timofeev.  With  respect  to \\ntiming, Papadopoulos acknowledged that he had met Mifsud and that Mifsud told him the Russians \\nhad “dirt” on Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails.”  But Papadopoulos stated multiple \\ntimes that those communications occurred before he joined the Trump Campaign and that it was a \\n“very strange coincidence” to be told of the “dirt” before he started working for the Campaign.  \\nThis account was false.  Papadopoulos met Mifsud for the first time on approximately March 14, \\n2016,  after  Papadopoulos  had  already  learned  he  would  be  a  foreign  policy  advisor  for  the \\n \\nCampaign.  Mifsud  showed  interest  in  Papadopoulos  only  after  learning  of  his  role  on  the \\nCampaign.  And  Mifsud  told  Papadopoulos  about  the  Russians  possessing  “dirt”  on  candidate \\nClinton in late April 2016, more than a month after Papadopoulos had joined the Campaign and \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n192 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

Oct. 5, 2017), Doc. 19 (“Papadopoulos Statement \\nof Offense”). \\n\\n \\nPapadopoulos  also  made  false  statements  in  an  effort  to  minimize  the  extent  and \\nimportance  of  his  communications  with  Mifsud.  For  example,  Papadopoulos  stated  that \\n“[Mifsud]’s  a  nothing,”  that  he  thought  Mifsud  was  “just  a  guy  talk[ing]  up  connections  or \\nsomething,” and that he believed Mifsud was “BS’ing to be completely honest with you.”  In fact, \\nhowever, Papadopoulos understood Mifsud to have substantial connections to high-level Russian \\ngovernment officials and that Mifsud spoke with some of those officials in Moscow before telling \\n \\nPapadopoulos about the “dirt.”  Papadopoulos also engaged in extensive communications over a \\nperiod of months with Mifsud about foreign policy issues for the Campaign, including efforts to \\narrange a “history making” meeting between the Campaign and Russian government officials.  In \\naddition, Papadopoulos failed to inform investigators that Mifsud had introduced him to Timofeev, \\nthe Russian national who Papadopoulos understood to be connected to the Russian Ministry of \\n \\nForeign Affairs, despite being asked if he had met with Russian nationals or “[a]nyone with a \\n \\nRussian accent” during the campaign.

He stated that the extent of \\n \\ntheir communications was her sending emails—“Just, ‘Hi, how are you?’ That’s it.”  In truth, \\nhowever, Papadopoulos met Polonskaya on March 24, 2016, after he had joined the Campaign; he \\n \\nbelieved that she had connections to high-level Russian government officials and could help him \\n \\narrange a potential foreign policy trip to Russia. During the campaign he emailed and spoke with \\nher  over  Skype  on  numerous  occasions  about  the  potential  foreign  policy  trip  to  Russia. \\nPapadopoulos Statement of Offense ¶¶ 30-31.   \\n \\n\\nPapadopoulos’s  false  statements  in  January  2017  impeded  the  FBI’s  investigation  into \\nRussian  interference  in  the  2016  presidential  election.  Most  immediately,  those  statements \\n \\nhindered investigators’ ability to effectively question Mifsud when he was interviewed in the lobby \\nof a Washington, D.C. hotel on February 10, 2017.  See Gov’t Sent. Mem. at 6, United States v. \\nGeorge Papadopoulos, No. 1:17-cr-182 (D.D.C. Aug. 18, 2017), Doc. 44.  During that interview, \\nMifsud  admitted  to  knowing  Papadopoulos  and  to  having  introduced  him  to  Polonskaya  and \\nTimofeev.  But Mifsud denied that he had advance knowledge that Russia was in possession of \\nemails  damaging  to  candidate  Clinton,  stating  that  he  and  Papadopoulos  had  discussed \\ncybersecurity and hacking as a larger issue and that Papadopoulos must have misunderstood their \\nconversation.  Mifsud also falsely stated that he had not seen Papadopoulos since the meeting at \\nwhich  Mifsud  introduced  him  to  Polonskaya,  even  though  emails,  text  messages,  and  other \\ninformation show that Mifsud met with Papadopoulos on at least two other occasions—April 12 \\nand April 26, 2016.  In addition, Mifsud omitted that he had drafted (or edited) the follow-up \\n \\nmessage that Polonskaya sent to Papadopoulos following the initial meeting and that, as reflected \\n \\nin the language of that email chain (“Baby, thank you!”), Mifsud may have been involved in a \\n \\npersonal  relationship  with  Polonskaya  at  the  time.    The  false  information  and  omissions  in \\nPapadopoulos’s  January  2017  interview  undermined  investigators’  ability  to  challenge  Mifsud \\nwhen he made these inaccurate statements. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n193 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

During  the \\ninterview, Flynn made several false statements pertaining to his communications with the Russian \\nambassador.  \\n \\nFirst, Flynn made two false statements about his conversations with Russian Ambassador \\n \\n \\nKislyak in late December 2016, at a time when the United States had imposed sanctions on Russia \\n \\nfor interfering with the 2016 presidential election and Russia was considering its response.  See \\n \\nFlynn Statement of Offense. Flynn told the agents that he did not ask Kislyak to refrain from \\n \\nescalating the situation in response to the United States’s imposition of sanctions.  That statement \\nwas false.  On December 29, 2016, Flynn called Kislyak to request Russian restraint.  Flynn made \\nthe call immediately after speaking to a senior Transition Team official (K.T. McFarland) about \\nwhat to communicate to Kislyak. Flynn then spoke with McFarland again after the Kislyak call to \\n \\nreport  on  the  substance  of  that  conversation.  Flynn  also  falsely  told  the  FBI  that  he  did  not \\nremember a follow-up conversation in which Kislyak stated that Russia had chosen to moderate \\nits response to the U.S. sanctions as a result of Flynn’s request.  On December 31, 2016, Flynn in \\nfact had such a conversation with Kislyak, and he again spoke with McFarland within hours of the \\ncall to relay the substance of his conversation with Kislyak.

That  statement  was  false.

Flynn \\nalso falsely stated that Kislyak never described Russia’s response to his December 22 request \\nregarding the resolution. Kislyak in fact told Flynn in a conversation on December 23, 2016, that \\nRussia would not vote against the resolution if it came to a vote.  See Flynn Statement of Offense \\n¶ 4. \\n \\n\\nFlynn made these false statements to the FBI at a time when he was serving as National \\nSecurity Advisor and when the FBI had an open investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 \\npresidential election, including the nature of any links between the Trump Campaign and Russia.  \\nFlynn’s  false  statements  and  omissions  impeded  and  otherwise  had  a  material  impact  on  that \\nongoing investigation.  Flynn Statement of Offense ¶¶ 1-2.  They also came shortly before Flynn \\nmade separate submissions to the Department of Justice, pursuant to FARA, that also contained \\nmaterially false statements and omissions.  Id. ¶ 5.  Based on the totality of that conduct, the Office \\ndecided  to  charge  Flynn  with  making  false  statements  to  the  FBI,  in  violation  of  18  U.S.C. \\n§ 1001(a).  On December 1, 2017, and pursuant to a plea agreement, Flynn pleaded guilty to that \\ncharge and also admitted his false statements to the Department in his FARA filing.  See id.; Plea \\nAgreement, United States v. Michael T. Flynn, No. 1:17-cr-232 (D.D.C. Dec. 1, 2017), Doc. 3.  \\nFlynn is awaiting sentencing.          \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\niv.  Michael Cohen \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nMichael  Cohen  was  the  executive  vice  president  and  special  counsel  to  the  Trump \\n \\nOrganization when Trump was president of the Trump Organization.  Information ¶ 1, United \\nStates v. Cohen, No. 1:18-cr-850 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 29, 2018), Doc. 2 (“Cohen Information”).  From \\nthe fall of 2015 through approximately June 2016, Cohen was involved in a project to build a \\n \\nTrump-branded tower and adjoining development in Moscow.  The project was known as Trump \\nTower Moscow. \\n\\n \\nIn 2017, Cohen was called to testify before the House Permanent Select Committee on \\nIntelligence (HPSCI) and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), both of which were \\ninvestigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible links between \\nRussia and the presidential campaigns.  In late August 2017, in advance of his testimony, Cohen \\ncaused a two-page statement to be sent to SSCI and HPSCI addressing Trump Tower Moscow.  \\nCohen Information ¶¶ 2-3.  The letter contained three representations relevant here.  First, Cohen \\nstated that the Trump Moscow project had ended in January 2016 and that he had briefed candidate \\n \\nTrump  on  the  project  only  three  times  before  making  the  unilateral  decision  to  terminate  it. \\n  \\nSecond, Cohen represented that he never agreed to travel to Russia in connection with the project \\n \\nand never considered asking Trump to travel for the project.  Third, Cohen stated that he did not \\nrecall any Russian government contact about the project, including any response to an email that \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n195 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nEach  of  the  foregoing  representations  in  Cohen’s  two-page  statement  was  false  and \\nmisleading.  Consideration  of  the  project  had  extended  through  approximately  June  2016  and \\nincluded more than three progress reports from Cohen to Trump. Cohen had discussed with Felix \\n \\nSater his own travel to Russia as part of the project, and he had inquired about the possibility of \\nTrump traveling there—both with the candidate himself and with senior campaign official Corey \\nLewandowski. Cohen did recall that he had received a response to the email that he sent to Russian \\n \\ngovernment spokesman Dmitry Peskov—in particular, that he received an email reply and had a \\nfollow-up phone conversation with an English-speaking assistant to Peskov in mid-January 2016.  \\nCohen  Information  ¶ 7.  Cohen  knew  the  statements  in  the  letter  to  be  false  at  the  time,  and \\nadmitted that he made them in an effort (1) to minimize the links between the project and Trump \\n(who by this time was President), and (2) to give the false impression that the project had ended \\n \\nbefore the first vote in the Republican Party primary process, in the hopes of limiting the ongoing \\n \\nRussia investigations.  Id. \\n\\n \\nGiven the nature of the false statements and the fact that he repeated them during his initial \\ninterview with the Office, we charged Cohen with violating Section 1001.  On November 29, 2018, \\nCohen pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to a single-count information charging him \\nwith  making  false  statements  in  a  matter  within  the  jurisdiction  of  the  legislative  branch,  in \\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(2) and (c).  Cohen Information.  The case was transferred to the \\ndistrict judge presiding over the separate prosecution of Cohen pursued by the Southern District \\nof New York (after a referral from our Office).  On December 7, 2018, this Office submitted a \\nletter to that judge recommending that Cohen’s cooperation with our investigation be taken into \\naccount in sentencing Cohen on both the false-statements charge and the offenses in the Southern \\n \\nDistrict  prosecution.  On  December  12,  2018,  the  judge  sentenced  Cohen  to  two  months  of \\nimprisonment  on  the  false-statements  count,  to  run  concurrently  with  a  36-month  sentence \\nimposed on the other counts.       \\n\\n    \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nhe had sent to a Russian government email account.  Cohen Information ¶ 4.  Cohen later asked \\nthat his two-page statement be incorporated into his testimony’s transcript before SSCI, and he \\nultimately gave testimony to SSCI that was consistent with that statement.

Jeff Sessions \\n\\nAs set forth in Volume I, Section IV.A.6, supra, the investigation established that, while a \\nU.S. Senator and a Trump Campaign advisor, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions interacted \\nwith Russian Ambassador Kislyak during the week of the Republican National Convention in July \\n2016 and again at a meeting in Sessions’s Senate office in September 2016.  The investigation also \\n \\nestablished that Sessions and Kislyak both attended a reception held before candidate Trump’s \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n197 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim.

In January 2017 testimony during his confirmation hearing, Sessions stated in response \\nto a question about Trump Campaign communications with the Russian government that he had \\n“been  called  a  surrogate  at  a  time  or  two  in  that  campaign  and  I  didn’t  have  –  did  not  have \\ncommunications with the Russians.”  In written responses submitted on January 17, 2017, Sessions \\nanswered “[n]o” to a question asking whether he had “been in contact with anyone connected to \\nany part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after election day.”  \\nAnd, in a March 2017 supplement to his testimony, Sessions identified two of the campaign-period \\ncontacts with Ambassador Kislyak noted above, which had been reported in the media following \\nthe January 2017 confirmation hearing.  Sessions stated in the supplemental response that he did \\n“not  recall  any  discussions  with  the  Russian  Ambassador,  or  any  other  representatives  of  the \\nRussian government, regarding the political campaign on these occasions or any other occasion.”  \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nAlthough  the  investigation  established  that  Sessions  interacted  with  Kislyak  on  the \\n \\noccasions described above and that Kislyak mentioned the presidential campaign on at least one \\noccasion, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that Sessions gave knowingly false answers to \\nRussia-related questions in light of the wording and context of those questions.  With respect to \\nSessions’s statements that he did “not recall any discussions with the Russian Ambassador . . . \\n \\nregarding the political campaign” and he had not been in contact with any Russian official “about \\nthe 2016 election,” the evidence concerning the nature of Sessions’s interactions with Kislyak \\nmakes it plausible that Sessions did not recall discussing the campaign with Kislyak at the time of \\nhis statements.  Similarly, while Sessions stated in his January 2017 oral testimony that he “did \\nnot have communications with Russians,” he did so in response to a question that had linked such \\ncommunications  to  an  alleged  “continuing  exchange  of  information”  between  the  Trump \\n \\nCampaign and Russian government intermediaries.  Sessions later explained to the Senate and to \\nthe Office that he understood the question as narrowly calling for disclosure of interactions with \\n \\nRussians that involved the exchange of campaign information, as distinguished from more routine \\ncontacts  with  Russian  nationals.  Given  the  context  in  which  the  question  was  asked,  that \\nunderstanding is plausible. \\n\\n \\nAccordingly, the Office concluded that the evidence was insufficient to prove that Sessions \\n \\nwas willfully untruthful in his answers and thus insufficient to obtain or sustain a conviction for \\n \\nperjury  or  false  statements.  Consistent  with  the  Principles  of  Federal  Prosecution,  the  Office \\ntherefore  determined  not  to  pursue  charges  against  Sessions  and  informed  his  counsel  of  that \\n \\ndecision in March 2018. \\n \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nvii.  Others Interviewed During the Investigation \\n  \\n\\n \\nThe Office considered whether, during the course of the investigation, other individuals \\n \\ninterviewed either omitted material information or provided information determined to be false.  \\nApplying the Principles of Federal Prosecution, the Office did not seek criminal charges against \\nany  individuals  other  than  those  listed  above. \\nIn  some  instances,  that  decision  was  due  to \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n198 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\nPP\\n \\n\\nevidentiary hurdles to proving falsity. In others, the Office determined that the witness  ultimately  \\nprovided  truthful  information  and  that  considerations  of  culpability,  deterrence,  and  resource-\\npreservation weighed against prosecution.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\nINTRODUCTION TO VOLUME II \\n\\nThis report is submitted to the Attorney General pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 600.8(c), which \\nstates that, “[a]t the conclusion of the Special Counsel’s work, he . . . shall provide the Attorney \\nGeneral  a  confidential  report  explaining  the  prosecution  or  declination  decisions  [the  Special \\nCounsel] reached.” \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nBeginning in 2017, the President of the United States took a variety of actions towards the \\nongoing FBI investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election and related \\nmatters that raised questions about whether he had obstructed justice.  The Order appointing the \\nSpecial Counsel gave this Office jurisdiction to investigate matters that arose directly from the \\nFBI’s Russia investigation, including whether the President had obstructed justice in connection \\nwith Russia-related investigations.  The Special Counsel’s jurisdiction also covered potentially \\nobstructive acts related to the Special Counsel’s investigation itself.  This Volume of our report \\n \\nsummarizes our obstruction-of-justice investigation of the President.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nWe first describe the considerations that guided our obstruction-of-justice investigation, \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nand then provide an overview of this Volume:  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFirst, a traditional prosecution or declination decision entails a binary determination to \\ninitiate  or  decline  a  prosecution,  but  we  determined  not  to  make  a  traditional  prosecutorial \\njudgment.  The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) has issued an opinion finding that “the indictment \\nor criminal prosecution of a sitting President would impermissibly undermine the capacity of the \\nexecutive  branch  to  perform  its  constitutionally  assigned  functions”  in  violation  of  “the \\nconstitutional separation of powers.”1  Given the role of the Special Counsel as an attorney in the \\nDepartment of Justice and the framework of the Special Counsel regulations, see 28 U.S.C. § 515; \\n28 C.F.R. § 600.7(a), this Office accepted OLC’s legal conclusion for the purpose of exercising \\nprosecutorial jurisdiction.  And apart from OLC’s constitutional view, we recognized that a federal \\ncriminal accusation against a sitting President would place burdens on the President’s capacity to \\n   \\ngovern and potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct.2 \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSecond, while the OLC opinion concludes that a sitting President may not be prosecuted, \\n \\nit recognizes that a criminal investigation during the President’s term is permissible.3  The OLC \\nopinion also recognizes that a President does not have immunity after he leaves office.4  And if \\nindividuals other than the President committed an obstruction offense, they may be prosecuted at \\nthis time.  Given those considerations, the facts known to us, and the strong public interest in \\n                                            \\n\\n   \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1  A Sitting President’s Amenability to Indictment and Criminal Prosecution, 24 Op. O.L.C. 222, \\n \\n \\n\\n222, 260 (2000) (OLC Op.).  \\n \\n\\n2  See U.S. CONST. Art. I § 2, cl. 5; § 3, cl. 6; cf. OLC Op. at 257-258 (discussing relationship \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nbetween impeachment and criminal prosecution of a sitting President). \\n\\n3 OLC Op. at 257 n.36 (“A grand jury could continue to gather evidence throughout the period of \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nimmunity”). \\n\\n4  OLC Op. at 255 (“Recognizing an immunity from prosecution for a sitting President would not \\n \\n \\n \\npreclude such prosecution once the President’s term is over or he is otherwise removed from office by \\nresignation or impeachment”).    \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\nsafeguarding  the  integrity  of  the  criminal  justice  system,  we  conducted  a  thorough  factual \\ninvestigation  in  order  to  preserve  the  evidence  when  memories  were  fresh  and  documentary \\nmaterials were available.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThird, we considered whether to evaluate the conduct we investigated under the Justice \\nManual standards governing prosecution and declination decisions, but we determined not to apply \\nan approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes.  The \\n \\nthreshold  step  under  the  Justice  Manual  standards  is  to  assess  whether  a  person’s  conduct \\n“constitutes a federal offense.”  U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Justice Manual § 9-27.220 (2018) (Justice \\nManual).  Fairness concerns counseled against potentially reaching that judgment when no charges \\ncan be brought.  The ordinary means for an individual to respond to an accusation is through a \\nspeedy and public trial, with all the procedural protections that surround a criminal case.  An \\nindividual who believes he was wrongly accused can use that process to seek to clear his name.  In \\n \\ncontrast, a prosecutor’s judgment that crimes were committed, but that no charges will be brought, \\naffords no such adversarial opportunity for public name-clearing before an impartial adjudicator.5 \\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nThe concerns about the fairness of such a determination would be heightened in the case \\n \\nof a sitting President, where a federal prosecutor’s accusation of a crime, even in an internal report, \\n \\ncould carry consequences that extend beyond the realm of criminal justice.  OLC noted similar \\nconcerns about sealed indictments.  Even if an indictment were sealed during the President’s term, \\n \\nOLC  reasoned,  “it  would  be  very  difficult  to  preserve  [an  indictment’s]  secrecy,”  and  if  an \\n \\nindictment became public, “[t]he stigma and opprobrium” could imperil the President’s ability to \\ngovern.”6  Although a prosecutor’s internal report would not represent a formal public accusation \\n \\nakin to an indictment, the possibility of the report’s public disclosure and the absence of a neutral \\n \\nadjudicatory  forum  to  review  its  findings  counseled  against  potentially  determining  “that  the \\nperson’s conduct constitutes a federal offense.”  Justice Manual § 9-27.220.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFourth, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President \\nclearly  did  not  commit  obstruction  of  justice,  we  would  so  state.  Based  on  the  facts  and  the \\napplicable  legal  standards,  however,  we  are  unable  to  reach  that  judgment.  The  evidence  we \\nobtained about the President’s actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from \\nconclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred.  Accordingly, while this report does \\nnot conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n* \\n\\n* \\n\\n* \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nThis report on our investigation consists of four parts.  Section I provides an overview of \\ninvestigatory  and  evidentiary \\nobstruction-of-justice  principles  and  summarizes  certain \\nconsiderations.  Section  II  sets  forth  the  factual  results  of  our  obstruction  investigation  and \\n \\nanalyzes the evidence.  Section III addresses statutory and constitutional defenses.  Section IV \\nstates our conclusion. \\n                                            \\n\\n5  For  that  reason,  criticisms  have  been  lodged  against  the  practice  of  naming  unindicted  co-\\n \\nconspirators in an indictment.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY TO VOLUME II \\n\\n \\n\\nOur  obstruction-of-justice  inquiry  focused  on  a  series  of  actions  by  the  President  that \\nrelated to the Russian-interference investigations, including the President’s conduct towards the \\n \\nlaw enforcement officials overseeing the investigations and the witnesses to relevant events.   \\n\\n \\n\\nFACTUAL RESULTS OF THE OBSTRUCTION INVESTIGATION \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe key issues and events we examined include the following: \\n\\nThe Campaign’s response to reports about Russian support for Trump.  During the 2016 \\npresidential  campaign,  questions  arose  about  the  Russian  government’s  apparent  support  for \\ncandidate Trump.  After WikiLeaks released politically damaging  Democratic Party emails that \\nwere reported to have been hacked by Russia, Trump publicly expressed skepticism  that Russia \\nwas responsible for the hacks at the same time  that he and other Campaign officials privately \\nsought  information \\nabout  any  further  planned  WikiLeaks \\nreleases.  Trump also denied having any business in or connections to Russia, even though as late \\nas June 2016 the Trump Organization had been pursuing a licensing deal for a  skyscraper to be \\nbuilt in Russia called Trump Tower Moscow.  After the election,  the President expressed concerns \\nto advisors that reports of Russia’s election interference might lead the public to question the \\nlegitimacy of his election.   \\n\\n \\n\\nConduct  involving  FBI  Director  Comey  and  Michael  Flynn.  In  mid-January  2017, \\n \\nincoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn falsely denied to the Vice President, other \\nadministration officials, and FBI agents that he had talked to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak \\nabout Russia’s response to U.S. sanctions on Russia for its election interference.  On January 27, \\n \\nthe day after the President was told that Flynn had lied to the Vice President and had made similar \\n \\nstatements to the FBI, the President invited FBI Director Comey to a private dinner at the White \\n \\nHouse  and  told  Comey  that  he  needed  loyalty.  On  February  14,  the  day  after  the  President \\n \\nrequested Flynn’s resignation, the President told an outside advisor, “Now that we fired Flynn, the \\nRussia thing is over.”  The advisor disagreed and said the investigations would continue.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nLater that afternoon, the President cleared the Oval Office to have a one-on-one meeting \\nwith Comey.  Referring to the FBI’s investigation of Flynn, the President said, “I hope you can \\nsee your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.  He is a good guy.  I hope you can let this \\ngo.”  Shortly after requesting Flynn’s resignation and speaking privately to Comey, the President \\nsought to have Deputy National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland draft an internal letter stating \\nthat the President had not directed Flynn to discuss sanctions with Kislyak.  McFarland declined \\nbecause she did not know whether that was true, and a White House Counsel’s Office attorney \\nthought that the request would look like a quid pro quo for an ambassadorship she had been offered.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  President’s  reaction  to  the  continuing  Russia  investigation.  In  February  2017, \\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions began to assess whether he had to recuse himself from campaign-\\nrelated investigations because of his role in the Trump Campaign.  In early March, the President \\ntold White House Counsel Donald McGahn to stop Sessions from recusing.  And after Sessions \\nannounced his recusal on March 2, the President expressed anger at the decision and told advisors \\nthat he should have an Attorney General who would protect him.  That weekend, the President \\ntook Sessions aside at an event and urged him to “unrecuse.”  Later in March, Comey publicly \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n3 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)Harm to Ongoing Matter\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\ndisclosed at a congressional hearing that the FBI was investigating “the Russian government’s \\nefforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,” including any links or coordination between \\nthe Russian government and the Trump Campaign.  In the following days, the President reached \\nout to the Director of National Intelligence and the leaders of the Central Intelligence Agency \\n(CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA) to ask them what they could do to publicly dispel  \\nthe suggestion that the President had any connection to the Russian election-interference effort. \\n \\nThe President also twice called Comey directly, notwithstanding guidance from McGahn to avoid \\ndirect contacts with the Department of Justice.  Comey had previously assured the President that \\n \\nthe FBI was not investigating him personally, and the President asked Comey to “lift the cloud” \\nof the Russia investigation by saying that publicly.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n   \\n\\nThe  President’s  termination  of  Comey.  On  May  3,  2017,  Comey  testified  in  a \\n \\ncongressional  hearing,  but  declined  to  answer  questions  about  whether  the  President  was \\npersonally under investigation.   Within days, the President decided to terminate Comey.  The \\nPresident insisted that the termination letter, which was written for public release, state that Comey \\nhad informed the President that he was not under investigation.  The day of the firing, the White \\n \\nHouse maintained that Comey’s termination resulted from independent recommendations from the \\n \\nAttorney General and Deputy Attorney General that Comey should be discharged for mishandling \\nthe  Hillary  Clinton  email  investigation.  But  the  President  had  decided  to  fire  Comey  before \\nhearing from the Department of Justice.  The day after firing Comey, the President told Russian \\nofficials that he had “faced great pressure because of Russia,” which had been “taken off” by \\n \\nComey’s firing.  The next day, the President acknowledged in a television interview that he was \\n \\ngoing to fire Comey regardless of the Department of Justice’s recommendation and that when he \\n“decided to just do it,” he was thinking that “this thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.”  \\nIn response to a question about whether he was angry with Comey about the Russia investigation, \\nthe President said, “As far as I’m concerned, I want that thing to be absolutely done properly,” \\nadding that firing Comey “might even lengthen out the investigation.”   \\nThe appointment of a Special Counsel and efforts to remove him.  On May 17, 2017, the \\n \\nActing Attorney General for the Russia investigation appointed a Special Counsel to conduct the \\ninvestigation and related matters.  The President reacted to news that a Special Counsel had been \\nappointed by telling advisors that it was “the end of his presidency” and demanding that Sessions \\nresign.  Sessions submitted his resignation, but the President ultimately did not accept it.  The \\nPresident told aides that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and suggested that the Special \\nCounsel therefore could not serve.  The President’s advisors told him the asserted conflicts were \\n \\nmeritless and had already been considered by the Department of Justice.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nOn June 14, 2017, the media reported that the Special Counsel’s Office was investigating \\n \\nwhether the President had obstructed justice.  Press reports called this “a major turning point” in \\n \\nthe investigation: while Comey had told the President he was not under investigation, following \\nComey’s firing, the President now was under investigation.  The President reacted to this news \\n \\nwith  a  series  of  tweets  criticizing  the  Department  of  Justice  and  the  Special  Counsel’s \\ninvestigation.  On June 17, 2017, the President called McGahn at home and directed him to call \\nthe Acting Attorney General and say that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and must be \\nremoved.  McGahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that he would resign rather \\nthan trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre.  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n4 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nEfforts to curtail the Special Counsel’s investigation.  Two days after directing McGahn \\nto have the Special Counsel removed, the President made another attempt to affect the course of \\nthe Russia investigation.   On June 19, 2017, the President met one-on-one in the Oval Office with \\nhis former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a trusted advisor outside the government, and \\ndictated a message for Lewandowski to deliver to Sessions.  The message said that Sessions should \\npublicly announce that, notwithstanding his recusal from the Russia investigation, the investigation \\n \\nwas “very unfair” to the President, the President had done nothing wrong, and Sessions planned to \\nmeet with the Special Counsel and “let [him] move forward with investigating election meddling \\nfor future elections.”  Lewandowski said he understood what the President wanted Sessions to do.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nOne  month  later,  in  another  private  meeting  with  Lewandowski  on  July  19,  2017,  the \\nPresident  asked  about  the  status  of  his  message  for  Sessions  to  limit  the  Special  Counsel \\ninvestigation to future election interference.  Lewandowski told the President that the message \\nwould be delivered soon.  Hours after that meeting, the President publicly criticized Sessions in an \\ninterview  with  the  New  York  Times,  and  then  issued  a  series  of  tweets  making  it  clear  that \\nSessions’s job was in jeopardy.  Lewandowski did not want to deliver the President’s message \\npersonally,  so  he  asked  senior  White  House  official  Rick  Dearborn  to  deliver  it  to  Sessions.  \\nDearborn was uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nEfforts to prevent public disclosure of evidence.  In the summer of 2017, the President \\nlearned that media outlets were asking questions about the June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump Tower \\n \\nbetween senior campaign officials, including Donald Trump Jr., and a Russian lawyer who was \\nsaid  to  be  offering  damaging  information  about  Hillary  Clinton  as  “part  of  Russia  and  its \\n \\ngovernment’s support for Mr. Trump.”  On several occasions, the President directed aides not to \\n \\npublicly disclose the emails setting up the June 9 meeting, suggesting that the emails would not \\n \\nleak and that the number of lawyers with access to them should be limited.  Before the emails \\nbecame  public,  the  President  edited  a  press  statement  for  Trump  Jr.  by  deleting  a  line  that \\nacknowledged that the meeting was with “an individual who [Trump Jr.] was told might have \\ninformation helpful to the campaign” and instead said only that the meeting was about adoptions \\nof Russian children.  When the press asked questions about the President’s involvement in Trump \\nJr.’s statement, the President’s personal lawyer repeatedly denied the President had played any \\nrole. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFurther efforts to have the Attorney General take control of the investigation.   In early \\n \\nsummer 2017, the President called Sessions at home and again asked him to reverse his recusal \\nfrom the Russia investigation.  Sessions did not reverse his recusal.  In October 2017, the President \\nmet privately with Sessions in the Oval Office and asked him to “take [a] look” at investigating \\nClinton. \\nIn  December  2017,  shortly  after  Flynn  pleaded  guilty  pursuant  to  a  cooperation \\nagreement, the President met with Sessions in the Oval Office and suggested, according to notes \\ntaken by a senior advisor, that if Sessions unrecused and took back supervision of the Russia \\ninvestigation, he would be a “hero.”  The President told Sessions, “I’m not going to do anything \\nor direct you to do anything.  I just want to be treated fairly.”  In response, Sessions volunteered \\nthat he had never seen anything “improper” on the campaign and told the President there was a \\n \\n“whole new leadership team” in place.  He did not unrecuse. \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nEfforts to have McGahn deny that the President had ordered him to have the Special \\nCounsel removed.  In early 2018, the press reported that the President had directed McGahn to \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n5 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\nhave the Special Counsel removed in June 2017 and that McGahn had threatened to resign rather \\nthan carry out the order.  The President reacted to the news stories by directing White House \\nofficials to tell McGahn to dispute the story and create a record stating he had not been ordered to \\nhave  the  Special  Counsel  removed.  McGahn  told  those  officials  that  the  media  reports  were \\n \\naccurate in stating that the President had directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed.  \\nThe President then met with McGahn in the Oval Office and again pressured him to deny the \\nreports.  In  the  same  meeting,  the  President  also  asked  McGahn  why  he  had  told  the  Special \\nCounsel about the President’s effort to remove the Special Counsel and why McGahn took notes \\nof his conversations with the President.  McGahn refused to back away from what he remembered \\nhappening and perceived the President to be testing his mettle. \\n  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nConduct towards Flynn, Manafort, \\n\\n \\n.  After Flynn withdrew from a joint defense \\nagreement with the President and began cooperating with the government, the President’s personal \\n \\ncounsel left a message for Flynn’s attorneys reminding them of the President’s warm feelings \\ntowards  Flynn,  which  he  said  “still  remains,”  and  asking  for  a  “heads  up”  if  Flynn  knew \\n“information that implicates the President.”  When Flynn’s counsel reiterated that Flynn could no \\nlonger share information pursuant to a joint defense agreement, the President’s personal counsel \\n \\nsaid he would make sure that the President knew that Flynn’s actions reflected “hostility” towards \\n \\nthe  President.  During  Manafort’s  prosecution  and  when  the  jury  in  his  criminal  trial  was \\n \\ndeliberating,  the  President  praised  Manafort  in  public,  said  that  Manafort  was  being  treated \\n \\nunfairly, and declined to rule out a \\npardon.  After Manafort was convicted, the President called \\nManafort  “a  brave  man”  for  refusing  to  “break”  and  said  that  “flipping”  “almost  ought  to  be  \\n \\noutlawed.” \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\nConduct involving Michael Cohen.  The President’s conduct towards Michael Cohen, a \\nformer Trump Organization executive, changed from praise for Cohen when he falsely minimized \\nthe President’s involvement in the Trump Tower Moscow project, to castigation of Cohen when \\nhe became a cooperating witness.  From September 2015 to June 2016, Cohen had pursued the \\nTrump Tower Moscow project on behalf of the Trump Organization and had briefed candidate \\nTrump on the project numerous times, including discussing whether Trump should travel to Russia \\nto  advance  the  deal.  In  2017,  Cohen  provided  false  testimony  to  Congress  about the  project, \\nincluding stating that he had only briefed Trump on the project three times and never discussed \\n \\ntravel to Russia with him, in an effort to adhere to a “party line” that Cohen said was developed to \\nminimize the President’s connections to Russia.  While preparing for his congressional testimony, \\nCohen had extensive discussions with the President’s personal counsel, who, according to Cohen, \\n \\nsaid that Cohen should “stay on message” and not contradict the President.  After the FBI searched \\n \\nCohen’s home and office in April 2018, the President publicly asserted that Cohen would not \\n“flip,” contacted him directly to tell him to “stay strong,” and privately passed messages of support \\nto him.  Cohen also discussed pardons with the President’s personal counsel and believed that if \\nhe stayed on message he would be taken care of.  But after Cohen began cooperating with the \\n \\ngovernment in the summer of 2018, the President publicly criticized him, called him a “rat,” and \\nsuggested that his family members had committed crimes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n6 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)HOMHarm to Ongoing Matter\\x0c \\n\\nOverarching factual issues.  We did not make a traditional prosecution decision about \\nthese facts, but the evidence we obtained supports several general statements about the President’s \\nconduct. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\nSeveral features of the conduct we investigated distinguish it from typical obstruction-of-\\njustice cases.  First, the investigation concerned the President, and some of his actions, such as \\nfiring the FBI director, involved facially lawful acts within his Article II authority, which raises \\nconstitutional issues discussed below.  At the same time, the President’s position as the head of \\nthe  Executive  Branch  provided  him  with  unique  and  powerful  means  of  influencing  official \\n \\nproceedings, subordinate officers, and potential witnesses—all of which is relevant to a potential \\nobstruction-of-justice analysis.  Second, unlike cases in which a subject engages in obstruction of \\njustice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not establish that the President was \\n \\ninvolved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference.  Although the obstruction \\nstatutes do not require proof of such a crime, the absence of that evidence affects the analysis of \\nthe President’s intent and requires consideration of other possible motives for his conduct.  Third, \\nmany of the President’s acts directed at witnesses, including discouragement of cooperation with \\nthe  government  and  suggestions  of  possible  future  pardons,  took  place  in  public  view.  That \\ncircumstance  is  unusual,  but  no  principle  of  law  excludes  public  acts  from  the  reach  of  the \\nobstruction laws.  If the likely effect of public acts is to influence witnesses or alter their testimony, \\n \\nthe harm to the justice system’s integrity is the same.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAlthough the series of events we investigated involved discrete acts, the overall pattern of \\n \\nthe President’s conduct towards the investigations can shed light on the nature of the President’s \\n \\nacts and the inferences that can be drawn about his intent.  In particular, the actions we investigated \\n \\ncan be divided into two phases, reflecting a possible shift in the President’s motives.  The first \\nphase covered the period from the President’s first interactions with Comey through the President’s \\nfiring of Comey.  During that time, the President had been repeatedly told he was not personally \\nunder investigation.  Soon after the firing of Comey and the appointment of the Special Counsel, \\nhowever,  the  President  became  aware  that  his  own  conduct  was  being  investigated  in  an \\nobstruction-of-justice inquiry.  At that point, the President engaged in a second phase of conduct, \\ninvolving public attacks on the investigation, non-public efforts to control it, and efforts in both \\n \\npublic and private to encourage witnesses not to cooperate with the investigation.  Judgments about \\nthe nature of the President’s motives during each phase would be informed by the totality of the \\nevidence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSTATUTORY AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEFENSES \\n \\n\\nThe  President’s  counsel  raised  statutory  and  constitutional  defenses  to  a  possible \\nobstruction-of-justice analysis of the conduct we investigated.  We concluded that none of those \\n \\nlegal defenses provided a basis for declining to investigate the facts.  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\nStatutory defenses.  Consistent with precedent and the Department of Justice’s general \\napproach to interpreting obstruction statutes, we concluded that several statutes could apply here.  \\nSee  18  U.S.C.  §§  1503,  1505,  1512(b)(3),  1512(c)(2).  Section  1512(c)(2)  is  an  omnibus \\n \\nobstruction-of-justice  provision  that  covers  a  range  of  obstructive  acts  directed  at  pending  or \\n \\ncontemplated official proceedings.  No principle of statutory construction justifies narrowing the \\nprovision to cover only conduct that impairs the integrity or availability of evidence.  Sections \\n1503 and 1505 also offer broad protection against obstructive acts directed at pending grand jury, \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n7 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\njudicial, administrative, and congressional proceedings, and they are supplemented by a provision \\nin Section 1512(b) aimed specifically at conduct intended to prevent or hinder the communication \\nto law enforcement of information related to a federal crime.  \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nConstitutional defenses.  As for constitutional defenses arising from the President’s status \\n \\nas the head of the Executive Branch, we recognized that the Department of Justice and the courts \\n \\nhave  not  definitively  resolved  these  issues.  We  therefore  examined  those  issues  through  the \\nframework established by Supreme Court precedent governing separation-of-powers issues.  The \\nDepartment of Justice and the President’s personal counsel have recognized that the President is \\nsubject to statutes that prohibit obstruction of justice by bribing a witness or suborning perjury \\n \\nbecause that conduct does not implicate his constitutional authority.  With respect to whether the \\n \\nPresident can be found to have obstructed justice by exercising his powers under Article II of the \\nConstitution, we concluded that Congress has authority to prohibit a President’s corrupt use of his \\nauthority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice.   \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nUnder applicable Supreme Court precedent, the Constitution does not categorically and \\npermanently immunize a President for obstructing justice through the use of his Article II powers.  \\nThe separation-of-powers doctrine authorizes Congress to protect official proceedings, including \\nthose of courts and grand juries, from corrupt, obstructive acts regardless of their source.  We also \\nconcluded that any inroad on presidential authority that would occur from prohibiting corrupt acts \\n \\ndoes  not  undermine  the  President’s  ability  to  fulfill  his  constitutional  mission.  The  term \\n“corruptly” sets a demanding standard.  It requires a concrete showing that a person acted with an \\nintent to obtain an improper advantage for himself or someone else, inconsistent with official duty \\nand the rights of others.  A preclusion of “corrupt” official action does not diminish the President’s \\nability to exercise Article II powers.  For example, the proper supervision of criminal law does not \\ndemand freedom for the President to act with a corrupt intention of shielding himself from criminal \\n \\npunishment, avoiding financial liability, or preventing personal embarrassment.  To the contrary, \\n \\na statute that prohibits official action undertaken for such corrupt purposes furthers, rather than \\nhinders, the impartial and evenhanded administration of the law.  It also aligns with the President’s \\n \\nconstitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws.  Finally, we concluded that in the rare case in \\n \\nwhich  a  criminal  investigation  of  the  President’s  conduct  is  justified,  inquiries  to  determine \\nwhether the President acted for a corrupt motive should not impermissibly chill his performance \\nof his constitutionally assigned duties.  The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction \\nlaws to the President’s corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional \\nsystem of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nCONCLUSION \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nBecause we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, we did not draw \\n \\nultimate  conclusions  about  the  President’s  conduct.  The  evidence  we  obtained  about  the \\nPresident’s actions and intent presents difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we were \\nmaking  a  traditional  prosecutorial  judgment.  At  the  same  time,  if  we  had  confidence  after  a \\nthorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, \\nwe would so state.  Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach \\nthat judgment.  Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a \\ncrime, it also does not exonerate him.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n    \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n8 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

BACKGROUND LEGAL AND EVIDENTIARY PRINCIPLES \\n \\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nA. \\n\\nLegal Framework of Obstruction of Justice \\n\\nThe May 17, 2017 Appointment Order and the Special Counsel regulations provide this \\nOffice with jurisdiction to investigate “federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent \\nto  interfere  with,  the  Special  Counsel\\'s  investigation,  such  as  perjury,  obstruction  of  justice, \\n \\ndestruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses.”  28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a).  Because of that \\ndescription of our jurisdiction, we sought evidence for our obstruction-of-justice investigation with \\nthe elements of obstruction offenses in mind.  Our evidentiary analysis is similarly focused on the \\nelements of such offenses, although we do not draw conclusions on the ultimate questions that \\ngovern a prosecutorial decision under the Principles of Federal Prosecution.  See Justice Manual \\n§ 9-27.000 et seq. (2018). \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nHere, we summarize the law interpreting the elements of potentially relevant obstruction \\nstatutes in an ordinary case.  This discussion does not address the unique constitutional issues that \\narise in an inquiry into official acts by the President.  Those issues are discussed in a later section \\nof  this  report  addressing  constitutional  defenses  that  the  President’s  counsel  have  raised.  See \\nVolume II, Section III.B, infra. \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThree  basic  elements  are  common  to  most  of  the  relevant  obstruction  statutes:  (1)  an \\nobstructive act; (2) a nexus between the obstructive act and an official proceeding; and (3) a corrupt \\n \\nintent.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 1503, 1505, 1512(c)(2).  We describe those elements as they have \\nbeen interpreted by the courts.  We then discuss a more specific statute aimed at witness tampering, \\nsee 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b), and describe the requirements for attempted offenses and endeavors to \\nobstruct justice, see 18 U.S.C. §§ 1503, 1512(c)(2). \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\nObstructive  act.  Obstruction-of-justice  law  “reaches  all  corrupt  conduct  capable  of \\nproducing an effect that prevents justice from being duly administered, regardless of the means \\nemployed.”  United States v. Silverman, 745 F.2d 1386, 1393 (11th Cir. 1984) (interpreting 18 \\nU.S.C. § 1503).  An “effort to influence” a proceeding can qualify as an endeavor to obstruct \\njustice  even  if  the  effort  was  “subtle  or  circuitous”  and  “however  cleverly  or  with  whatever \\n \\ncloaking of purpose” it was made.  United States v. Roe, 529 F.2d 629, 632 (4th Cir. 1975); see \\nalso United States v. Quattrone, 441 F.3d 153, 173 (2d Cir. 2006).  The verbs “‘obstruct or impede’ \\n \\nare broad” and “can refer to anything that blocks, makes difficult, or hinders.”  Marinello v. United \\nStates, 138 S. Ct. 1101, 1106 (2018) (internal brackets and quotation marks omitted). \\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAn improper motive can render an actor’s conduct criminal even when the conduct would \\notherwise be lawful and within the actor’s authority.  See United States v. Cueto, 151 F.3d 620, \\n631 (7th Cir. 1998) (affirming obstruction conviction of a criminal defense attorney for “litigation-\\nrelated conduct”); United States v. Cintolo, 818 F.2d 980, 992 (1st Cir. 1987) (“any act by any \\nparty—whether lawful or unlawful on its face—may abridge § 1503 if performed with a corrupt \\n \\nmotive”). \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nNexus  to  a  pending  or  contemplated  official  proceeding.  Obstruction-of-justice  law \\ngenerally requires a nexus, or connection, to an official proceeding.  In Section 1503, the nexus \\nmust be to pending “judicial or grand jury proceedings.”  United States v. Aguilar, 515 U.S. 593, \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n9 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n599 (1995).  In Section 1505, the nexus can include a connection to a “pending” federal agency \\nproceeding or a congressional inquiry or investigation.  Under both statutes, the government must \\n \\ndemonstrate  “a  relationship  in  time,  causation,  or  logic”  between  the  obstructive  act  and  the \\nproceeding or inquiry to be obstructed.  Id. at 599; see also Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States, \\n \\n544 U.S. 696, 707-708 (2005).  Section 1512(c) prohibits obstructive efforts aimed at official \\nproceedings  including  judicial  or  grand  jury  proceedings.  18  U.S.C.  § 1515(a)(1)(A).  “For \\npurposes of” Section 1512, “an official proceeding need not be pending or about to be instituted \\nat the time of the offense.”  18 U.S.C. § 1512(f)(1).  Although a proceeding need not already be in \\n \\nprogress to trigger liability under Section 1512(c), a nexus to a contemplated proceeding still must \\nbe shown.  United States v. Young, 916 F.3d 368, 386 (4th Cir. 2019); United States v. Petruk, 781 \\nF.3d 438, 445 (8th Cir. 2015); United States v. Phillips, 583 F.3d 1261, 1264 (10th Cir. 2009); \\nUnited States v. Reich, 479 F.3d 179, 186 (2d Cir. 2007).  The nexus requirement narrows the \\n \\nscope  of  obstruction  statutes  to  ensure  that  individuals  have  “fair  warning”  of  what  the  law \\n \\nproscribes.  Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 600 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe nexus showing has subjective and objective components.  As an objective matter, a \\n \\ndefendant must act “in a manner that is likely to obstruct justice,” such that the statute “excludes \\n \\ndefendants who have an evil purpose but use means that would only unnaturally and improbably \\nbe successful.”  Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 601-602 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted).  \\n“[T]he  endeavor  must  have  the  natural  and  probable  effect  of  interfering  with  the  due \\nadministration  of  justice.”  Id.  at  599  (citation  and  internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  As  a \\n \\nsubjective  matter,  the  actor  must  have  “contemplated  a  particular,  foreseeable  proceeding.” \\nPetruk, 781 F.3d at 445-446.  A defendant need not directly impede the proceeding.  Rather, a \\n \\nnexus exists if “discretionary actions of a third person would be required to obstruct the judicial \\n \\nproceeding if it was foreseeable to the defendant that the third party would act on the [defendant’s] \\ncommunication in such a way as to obstruct the judicial proceeding.”  United States v. Martinez, \\n862 F.3d 223, 238 (2d Cir. 2017) (brackets, ellipses, and internal quotation marks omitted).   \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n   \\n\\nCorruptly.  The word “corruptly” provides the intent element for obstruction of justice and \\n \\nmeans  acting  “knowingly  and  dishonestly”  or  “with  an  improper  motive.”  United  States  v. \\n \\nRichardson, 676 F.3d 491, 508 (5th Cir. 2012); United States v. Gordon, 710 F.3d 1124, 1151 \\n(10th Cir. 2013) (to act corruptly means to “act[] with an improper purpose and to engage in \\nconduct knowingly and dishonestly with the specific intent to subvert, impede or obstruct” the \\nrelevant proceeding) (some quotation marks omitted); see 18 U.S.C. § 1515(b) (“As used in section \\n1505, the term ‘corruptly’ means acting with an improper purpose, personally or by influencing \\nanother.”);  see  also  Arthur  Andersen,  544  U.S.  at  705-706  (interpreting  “corruptly”  to  mean \\n“wrongful, immoral, depraved, or evil” and holding that acting “knowingly . . . corruptly” in 18 \\nU.S.C. § 1512(b) requires “consciousness of wrongdoing”).  The requisite showing is made when \\na person acted with an intent to obtain an “improper advantage for [him]self or someone else, \\ninconsistent with official duty and the rights of others.”  BALLENTINE’S LAW DICTIONARY 276 (3d \\ned. 1969); see United States v. Pasha, 797 F.3d 1122, 1132 (D.C. Cir. 2015); Aguilar, 515 U.S. at \\n616  (Scalia,  J.,  concurring  in  part and  dissenting  in  part)  (characterizing  this definition  as  the \\n \\n“longstanding and well-accepted meaning” of “corruptly”).  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nWitness tampering.  A more specific provision in Section 1512 prohibits tampering with a \\n \\nwitness.  See 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b)(1), (3) (making it a crime to “knowingly use[] intimidation  . . . \\n \\nor  corruptly  persuade[]  another  person,”  or  “engage[]  in  misleading  conduct  towards  another \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n10 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n  \\n\\nperson,” with the intent to “influence, delay, or prevent the testimony of any person in an official \\nproceeding” or to “hinder, delay, or prevent the communication to a law enforcement officer . . . \\n \\nof information relating to the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense”).  To \\nestablish corrupt persuasion, it is sufficient that the defendant asked a potential witness to lie to \\n \\ninvestigators in contemplation of a likely federal investigation into his conduct.  United States v. \\nEdlind, 887 F.3d 166, 174 (4th Cir. 2018); United States v. Sparks, 791 F.3d 1188, 1191-1192 \\n(10th Cir. 2015);  United States v. Byrne, 435 F.3d 16, 23-26 (1st Cir. 2006); United States v. \\nLaShay, 417 F.3d 715, 718-719  (7th Cir. 2005); United States v. Burns, 298 F.3d 523, 539-540 \\n(6th  Cir.  2002);  United  States  v.  Pennington,  168  F.3d  1060,  1066  (8th  Cir.  1999).  The \\n \\n“persuasion” need not be coercive, intimidating, or explicit; it is sufficient to “urge,” “induce,” \\n“ask[],” “argu[e],” “giv[e] reasons,” Sparks, 791 F.3d at 1192, or “coach[] or remind[] witnesses \\nby planting misleading facts,” Edlind, 887 F.3d at 174.  Corrupt persuasion is shown “where a \\n \\ndefendant tells a potential witness a false story as if the story were true, intending that the witness \\nbelieve the story and testify to it.”  United States v. Rodolitz, 786 F.2d 77, 82 (2d Cir. 1986); see \\nUnited States v. Gabriel, 125 F.3d 89, 102 (2d Cir. 1997).  It also covers urging a witness to recall \\na fact that the witness did not know, even if the fact was actually true.  See LaShay, 417 F.3d at \\n719.  Corrupt  persuasion  also  can  be  shown  in  certain  circumstances  when  a  person,  with  an \\nimproper motive, urges a witness not to cooperate with law enforcement.  See United States v. \\nShotts, 145 F.3d 1289, 1301 (11th Cr. 1998) (telling Secretary “not to [say] anything [to the FBI] \\nand [she] would not be bothered”). \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen the charge is acting with the intent to hinder, delay, or prevent the communication \\n \\nof information to law enforcement under Section 1512(b)(3), the “nexus” to a proceeding inquiry \\n \\narticulated in Aguilar—that an individual have “knowledge that his actions are likely to affect the \\n \\njudicial proceeding,” 515 U.S. at 599—does not apply because the obstructive act is aimed at the \\ncommunication of information to investigators, not at impeding an official proceeding.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nActing “knowingly . . . corruptly” requires proof that the individual was “conscious of \\nwrongdoing.”  Arthur Andersen, 544 U.S. at 705-706 (declining to explore “[t]he outer limits of \\n \\nthis element” but indicating that an instruction was infirm where it permitted conviction even if \\nthe defendant “honestly and sincerely believed that [the] conduct was lawful”).  It is an affirmative \\n \\ndefense that “the conduct consisted solely of lawful conduct and that the defendant’s sole intention \\nwas to encourage, induce, or cause the other person to testify truthfully.”  18 U.S.C. § 1512(e). \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAttempts and endeavors.  Section 1512(c)(2) covers both substantive obstruction offenses \\n \\nand attempts to obstruct justice.  Under general principles of attempt law, a person is guilty of an \\n \\nattempt  when  he  has  the  intent  to  commit  a  substantive  offense  and  takes  an  overt  act  that \\nconstitutes a substantial step towards that goal.  See United States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. \\n102, 106-107 (2007).  “[T]he act [must be] substantial, in that it was strongly corroborative of the \\ndefendant’s criminal purpose.”  United States v. Pratt, 351 F.3d 131, 135 (4th Cir. 2003).  While \\n“mere  abstract  talk”  does  not  suffice,  any  “concrete  and  specific”  acts  that  corroborate  the \\ndefendant’s intent can constitute a “substantial step.”  United States v. Irving, 665 F.3d 1184, 1198-\\n1205 (10th Cir. 2011).  Thus, “soliciting an innocent agent to engage in conduct constituting an \\n \\nelement of the crime” may qualify as a substantial step.  Model Penal Code § 5.01(2)(g); see United \\n \\nStates v. Lucas, 499 F.3d 769, 781 (8th Cir. 2007). \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n11 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nThe omnibus clause of 18 U.S.C. § 1503 prohibits an “endeavor” to obstruct justice, which \\nsweeps more broadly than Section 1512’s attempt provision.  See United States v. Sampson, 898 \\nF.3d 287, 302 (2d Cir. 2018); United States v. Leisure, 844 F.2d 1347, 1366-1367 (8th Cir. 1988) \\n(collecting cases).  “It is well established that a[n] [obstruction-of-justice] offense is complete \\nwhen  one  corruptly  endeavors  to  obstruct  or  impede  the  due  administration  of  justice;  the \\nprosecution  need  not  prove  that  the  due  administration  of  justice  was  actually  obstructed  or \\nimpeded.”  United States v. Davis, 854 F.3d 1276, 1292 (11th Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks \\nomitted). \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nB. \\n\\nInvestigative and Evidentiary Considerations \\n\\nAfter  the  appointment  of  the  Special  Counsel,  this  Office  obtained  evidence  about  the \\n \\n\\nfollowing events relating to potential issues of obstruction of justice involving the President:   \\n\\n \\n\\n(a)  The President’s January 27, 2017 dinner with former FBI Director James Comey in which \\n \\nthe President reportedly asked for Comey’s loyalty, one day after the White House had \\nbeen briefed by the Department of Justice on contacts between former National Security \\nAdvisor Michael Flynn and the Russian Ambassador;  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(b)  The President’s February 14, 2017 meeting with Comey in which the President reportedly \\n\\n \\n\\nasked Comey not to pursue an investigation of Flynn; \\n\\n \\n\\n(c)  The President’s private requests to Comey to make public the fact that the President was \\nnot the subject of an FBI investigation and to lift what the President regarded as a cloud;   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(d) The President’s outreach to the Director of National Intelligence and the Directors of the \\nNational Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency about the FBI’s Russia \\n \\ninvestigation; \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(e)  The  President’s  stated  rationales  for  terminating  Comey  on  May  9,  2017,  including \\nstatements that could reasonably be understood as acknowledging that the FBI’s Russia \\n \\ninvestigation was a factor in Comey’s termination; and  \\n\\n \\n\\n(f)   The President’s reported involvement in issuing a statement about the June 9, 2016 Trump \\nTower  meeting  between  Russians  and  senior  Trump  Campaign  officials  that  said  the \\nmeeting was about adoption and omitted that the Russians had offered to provide the \\nTrump Campaign with derogatory information about Hillary Clinton.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nTaking into account that information and our analysis of applicable statutory and constitutional \\nprinciples  (discussed  below  in  Volume  II,  Section  III,  infra),  we  determined  that  there  was  a \\nsufficient  factual  and  legal  basis  to  further  investigate  potential  obstruction-of-justice  issues \\ninvolving the President. \\n\\n \\n\\nMany of the core issues in an obstruction-of-justice investigation turn on an individual’s \\nactions and intent.  We therefore requested that the White House provide us with documentary \\nevidence in its possession on the relevant events.  We also sought and obtained the White House’s \\nconcurrence in our conducting interviews of White House personnel who had relevant information.  \\nAnd  we  interviewed  other  witnesses  who  had  pertinent  knowledge,  obtained  documents  on  a \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n12 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\nvoluntary basis when possible, and used legal process where appropriate.  These investigative steps \\nallowed us to gather a substantial amount of evidence.    \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\ndiscussion, the President declined to be interviewed. \\n\\nWe  also  sought  a  voluntary  interview  with  the  President.  After  more  than  a  year  of \\n \\n \\nDuring the course of our discussions, \\nthe  President  did  agree  to  answer   written  questions  on  certain  Russia-related  topics,  and  he \\nprovided us with answers.  He did not similarly agree to provide written answers to questions on \\nobstruction topics or questions on events during the transition.  Ultimately,  while we believed that  \\nwe had the authority and  legal justification  to issue a grand jury subpoena to obtain the President’s \\ntestimony, we chose not to do so.  We made that decision in view of the substantial delay that such \\nan investigative step  would likely  produce at a  late stage in  our investigation.   We also assessed  \\nthat based on the significant body of evidence we had already obtained of the President’s actions \\nand his public and private statements describing or explaining those actions, we had sufficient \\nevidence to understand relevant events and to make certain assessments without the President’s \\ntestimony.    The  Office’s  decision-making  process  on  this  issue  is  described  in  more  detail  in \\nAppendix C, infra, in a note that precedes the President’s written responses.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIn assessing the evidence we obtained, we relied on common principles that apply in any \\ninvestigation.  The issue of criminal intent is often inferred from circumstantial evidence.  See, \\n \\ne.g., United States v. Croteau, 819 F.3d 1293, 1305 (11th Cir. 2016) (“[G]uilty knowledge can \\nrarely be established by direct evidence. . . .

Robinson,  702  F.3d  22,  36  (2d  Cir.  2012)  (“The  government’s  case  rested  on \\ncircumstantial evidence, but the mens rea elements of knowledge and intent can often be proved \\nthrough  circumstantial  evidence  and  the  reasonable  inferences  drawn  therefrom.”)  (internal \\n \\nquotation marks omitted).  The principle that intent can be inferred from circumstantial evidence \\n \\nis a necessity in criminal cases, given the right of a subject to assert his privilege against compelled \\n \\nself-incrimination  under  the  Fifth  Amendment  and  therefore  decline  to  testify.  Accordingly, \\n \\ndeterminations  on  intent  are  frequently  reached  without  the  opportunity  to  interview  an \\ninvestigatory subject. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nObstruction-of-justice cases are consistent with this rule.  See, e.g., Edlind, 887 F.3d at \\n174, 176 (relying on “significant circumstantial evidence that [the defendant] was conscious of her \\n \\nwrongdoing”  in  an  obstruction  case;  “[b]ecause  evidence  of  intent  will  almost  always  be \\ncircumstantial,  a  defendant  may  be  found  culpable  where  the  reasonable  and  foreseeable \\nconsequences of her acts are the obstruction of justice”) (internal quotation marks, ellipses, and \\npunctuation omitted); Quattrone, 441 F.3d at 173-174.  Circumstantial evidence that illuminates \\n \\nintent may include a pattern of potentially obstructive acts.  Fed. R.

[to] prov[e] motive, opportunity, intent, \\npreparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.”); see, e.g., United \\n \\nStates v.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)Grand Jury\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\nassessing credibility.  These include whether a witness had a reason not to tell the truth; whether \\nthe witness had a good memory; whether the witness had the opportunity to observe the events \\n \\nabout which he testified; whether the witness’s testimony was corroborated by other witnesses; \\nand whether anything the witness said or wrote previously contradicts his testimony.  See, e.g., \\n \\nFirst  Circuit  Pattern  Jury  Instructions  §  1.06  (2018);  Fifth  Circuit  Pattern  Jury  Instructions \\n(Criminal Cases) § 1.08 (2012); Seventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction § 3.01 (2012). \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIn addition to those general factors, we took into account more specific factors in assessing \\nthe credibility of conflicting accounts of the facts.  For example, contemporaneous written notes \\n \\ncan provide strong corroborating evidence.  See United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 232 (1975) \\n(the fact that a “statement appeared in the contemporaneously recorded report . . . would tend \\nstrongly  to  corroborate  the  investigator’s  version  of  the  interview”).  Similarly,  a  witness’s \\n \\nrecitation  of  his  account  before  he  had  any  motive  to  fabricate  also  supports  the  witness’s \\ncredibility.  See Tome v. United States, 513 U.S. 150, 158 (1995) (“A consistent statement that \\npredates  the  motive  is  a  square  rebuttal  of  the  charge  that  the  testimony  was  contrived  as  a \\n \\nconsequence of that motive.”).  Finally, a witness’s false description of an encounter can imply \\nconsciousness of wrongdoing.  See Al-Adahi v. Obama, 613 F.3d 1102, 1107 (D.C. Cir. 2010) \\n(noting the “well-settled principle that false exculpatory statements are evidence—often strong \\nevidence—of guilt”).  We applied those settled legal principles in evaluating the factual results of \\n \\nour investigation. \\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n14 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

We first provide an overview \\n \\nof how Russia became an issue in the 2016 presidential campaign, and how candidate Trump \\nresponded. We then turn to the key events that we investigated: the President’s conduct concerning \\nthe FBI investigation of Michael Flynn; the President’s reaction to public confirmation of the FBI’s \\n \\nRussia investigation; events leading up to and surrounding the termination of FBI Director Comey; \\nefforts  to  terminate  the  Special  Counsel;  efforts  to  curtail  the  scope  of  the  Special  Counsel’s \\ninvestigation; efforts to prevent disclosure of information about the June 9, 2016 Trump Tower \\nmeeting between Russians and senior campaign officials; efforts to have the Attorney General \\nunrecuse; and conduct towards McGahn, Cohen, and other witnesses.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\nWe summarize the evidence we found and then analyze it by reference to the three statutory \\n \\nobstruction-of-justice elements:  obstructive act, nexus to a proceeding, and intent.  We focus on \\n \\nelements because, by regulation, the Special Counsel has “jurisdiction . . . to investigate . . . federal \\ncrimes  committed  in  the  course  of,  and  with  intent  to  interfere  with,  the  Special  Counsel’s \\ninvestigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of \\nwitnesses.”  28  C.F.R.  §  600.4(a).  Consistent  with  our  jurisdiction  to  investigate  federal \\nobstruction crimes,  we  gathered  evidence  that  is  relevant  to  the  elements  of  those  crimes  and \\nanalyzed  them  within  an  elements  framework—while  refraining  from  reaching  ultimate \\nconclusions about whether crimes were committed, for the reasons explained above.  This section \\nalso does not address legal and constitutional defenses raised by counsel for the President; those \\ndefenses are analyzed in Volume II, Section III, infra. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nA. \\n\\nThe Campaign’s Response to Reports About Russian Support for Trump \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\nDuring the 2016 campaign, the media raised questions about a possible connection between \\n \\nthe Trump Campaign and Russia.7  The questions intensified after WikiLeaks released politically \\ndamaging Democratic Party emails that were reported to have been hacked by Russia.  Trump \\nresponded to questions about possible connections to Russia by denying any business involvement \\n \\nin Russia—even though the Trump Organization had pursued a business project in Russia as late \\n \\nas June 2016.  Trump also expressed skepticism that Russia had hacked the emails at the same \\n \\ntime as he and other Campaign advisors privately sought information \\nabout any \\nfurther planned WikiLeaks releases.  After the election, when questions persisted about possible \\nlinks  between  Russia  and  the  Trump  Campaign,  the  President-Elect  continued  to  deny  any \\n \\nconnections  to  Russia  and  privately  expressed  concerns  that  reports  of  Russian  election \\n   \\ninterference might lead the public to question the legitimacy of his election.8 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                            \\n\\n7  This  section  summarizes  and  cites  various  news  stories  not  for  the  truth  of  the  information \\n \\ncontained in the stories, but rather to place candidate Trump’s response to those stories in context.  Volume \\n \\nI of this report analyzes the underlying facts of several relevant events that were reported on by the media \\nduring the campaign. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n8 As discussed in Volume I, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals \\n \\n \\nwith ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence \\nwas  not  sufficient  to  charge  that  any  member  of  the  Trump  Campaign  conspired  or  coordinated  with \\nrepresentatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n15 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

After the press reported on \\nFlynn’s contacts with the Russian Ambassador, Flynn lied to incoming Administration officials \\nby saying he had not discussed sanctions on the calls.  The officials publicly repeated those lies in \\npress  interviews.  The  FBI,  which  previously  was  investigating  Flynn  for  other  matters, \\ninterviewed him about the calls in the first week after the inauguration, and Flynn told similar lies \\nto the FBI.  On January 26, 2017, Department of Justice (DOJ) officials notified the White House \\nthat  Flynn  and  the  Russian  Ambassador  had  discussed  sanctions  and  that  Flynn  had  been \\ninterviewed by the FBI.  The next night, the President had a private dinner with FBI Director James \\nComey in which he asked for Comey’s loyalty.  On February 13, 2017, the President asked Flynn \\nto resign.  The following day, the President had a one-on-one conversation with Comey in which \\nhe said, “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.” \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nEvidence \\n\\n1.

DOJ Officials Notify the White House of Their Concerns About Flynn  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n   \\n\\nOn January 26, 2017, Acting Attorney General Sally Yates contacted White House Counsel \\n \\nDonald  McGahn  and  informed  him  that  she  needed  to  discuss  a  sensitive  matter  with  him  in \\n \\nperson.142  Later  that  day,  Yates  and  Mary  McCord,  a  senior  national  security  official  at  the \\nDepartment of Justice, met at the White House with McGahn and White House Counsel’s Office \\nattorney James Burnham.143  Yates said that the public statements made by the Vice President \\ndenying that Flynn and Kislyak discussed sanctions were not true and put Flynn in a potentially \\n \\ncompromised position because the Russians would know he had lied.144  Yates disclosed that Flynn \\nhad been interviewed by the FBI.145  She declined to answer a specific question about how Flynn \\nhad performed during that interview,146 but she indicated that Flynn’s statements to the FBI were \\n \\nsimilar  to  the  statements  he  had  made  to  Pence  and  Spicer  denying  that  he  had  discussed \\nsanctions.147  McGahn came away from the meeting with the impression that the FBI had not \\npinned Flynn down in lies,148  but he asked John Eisenberg, who served as legal advisor to the \\nNational Security Council, to examine potential legal issues raised by Flynn’s FBI interview and \\nhis contacts with Kislyak.149 \\n\\n     \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\nThat afternoon, McGahn notified the President that Yates had come to the White House to \\ndiscuss concerns about Flynn.150  McGahn described what Yates had told him, and the President \\n \\nasked him to repeat it, so he did.151  McGahn recalled that when he described the FBI interview of \\n \\nFlynn, he said that Flynn did not disclose having discussed sanctions with Kislyak, but that there \\nmay not have been a clear violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001.152  The President asked about Section \\n \\n1001, and McGahn explained the law to him, and also explained the Logan Act.153  The President \\n                                            \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n142 Yates 8/15/17 302, at 6. \\n \\n143  Yates  8/15/17  302,  at  6;  McCord  7/17/17  302,  at  6;  SCR015_000198  (2/15/17  Draft \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMemorandum to file from the Office of the Counsel to the President). \\n\\n144  Yates  8/15/17  302,  at  6-8;  McCord  7/17/17  302,  at  6-7;  Burnham  11/3/17  302,  at  4; \\n \\n\\n \\nSCR015_000198 (2/15/17 Draft Memorandum to file from the Office of the Counsel to the President). \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n145  McGahn 11/30/17 302, at 5; Yates 8/15/17 302, at 7; McCord 7/17/17 302, at 7; Burnham \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n11/3/17 302, at 4. \\n\\n146 Yates 8/15/17 302, at 7; McCord 7/17/17 302, at 7. \\n \\n147  SCR015_000198 (2/15/17 Draft Memorandum to file from the Office of the Counsel to the \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nPresident); Burnham 11/3/17 302, at 4. \\n148 McGahn 11/30/17 302, at 5. \\n \\n149  SCR015_000198 (2/15/17 Draft Memorandum to file from the Office of the Counsel to the \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nPresident); McGahn 11/30/17 302, at 6, 8. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n150  McGahn 11/30/17 302, at 6; SCR015_000278 (White House Counsel’s Office Memorandum \\nre: “Flynn Tick Tock”) (on January 26, “McGahn IMMEDIATELY advises POTUS”); SCR015_000198 \\n \\n(2/15/17 Draft Memorandum to file from the Office of the Counsel to the President). \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n151 McGahn 11/30/17 302, at 6. \\n \\n152 McGahn 11/30/17 302, at 7. \\n \\n153 McGahn 11/30/17 302, at 7. \\n\\n \\n\\n31 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

Flynn’s Resignation \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\nOn February 2, 2017, Eisenberg reviewed the underlying information relating to Flynn’s \\n \\ncalls with Kislyak.189  Eisenberg recalled that he prepared a memorandum about criminal statutes \\nthat  could  apply  to  Flynn’s  conduct,  but  he  did  not  believe  the  White  House  had  enough \\ninformation to make a definitive recommendation to the President.190  Eisenberg and McGahn \\n \\ndiscussed  that  Eisenberg’s  review  of  the  underlying  information  confirmed  his  preliminary \\nconclusion that Flynn was unlikely to be prosecuted for violating the Logan Act.191  Because White \\nHouse officials were uncertain what Flynn had told the FBI, however, they could not assess his \\n \\nexposure to prosecution for violating 18 U.S.C. § 1001.192 \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nThe week of February 6, Flynn had a one-on-one conversation with the President in the \\nOval Office about the negative media coverage of his contacts with Kislyak.193  Flynn recalled that \\nthe President was upset and asked him for information on the conversations.194  Flynn listed the \\nspecific dates on which he remembered speaking with Kislyak, but the President corrected one of \\nthe  dates  he  listed.195    The  President  asked  Flynn  what  he  and  Kislyak  discussed  and  Flynn \\n  \\nresponded that he might have talked about sanctions.196 \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                            \\nmemorandum  documenting  the  dinner  to  his  senior  leadership  team,  and  McCabe  confirmed  that  the \\nmemorandum captured what Comey said on the telephone call immediately following the dinner.

For example, Comey recalled, and his memoranda reflect, \\nthat he told the President in his January 6, 2017 meeting, and on phone calls on March 30 and April 11, \\n2017, that the FBI was not investigating the President personally.  On May 8, 2017, during White House \\ndiscussions about firing Comey, the President told Rosenstein and others that Comey had told him three \\n \\ntimes that he was not under investigation, including once in person and twice on the phone.

According to Comey’s account of his February 14, 2017 meeting \\n \\nin the Oval Office, the President told him, “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to \\n \\nletting Flynn go. . . . I hope you can let this go.”  In analyzing whether these statements constitute \\nan obstructive act, a threshold question is whether Comey’s account of the interaction is accurate, \\nand, if so, whether the President’s statements had the tendency to impede the administration of \\njustice by shutting down an inquiry that could result in a grand jury investigation and a criminal \\ncharge. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nAfter Comey’s account of the President’s request to “let[] Flynn go” became public, the \\nPresident publicly disputed several aspects of the story.  The President told the New York Times \\nthat he did not “shoo other people out of the room” when he talked to Comey and that he did not \\nremember having a one-on-one conversation with Comey.268  The President also publicly denied \\nthat he had asked Comey to “let[] Flynn go” or otherwise communicated that Comey should drop \\n \\nthe investigation of Flynn.269  In private, the President denied aspects of Comey’s account to White \\nHouse advisors, but acknowledged to Priebus that he brought Flynn up in the meeting with Comey \\nand stated that Flynn was a good guy.270  Despite those denials, substantial evidence corroborates \\nComey’s account. \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                            \\n\\n266 @realDonaldTrump 3/31/17 (7:04 a.m. ET) Tweet; see Shane Harris at al., Mike Flynn Offers \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nto Testify in Exchange for Immunity, Wall Street Journal (Mar. 30, 2017). \\n\\n     \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n267 McFarland 12/22/17 302, at 18. \\n \\n268  Excerpts From The Times’s Interview With Trump, New York Times (July 19, 2017).

McGahn  recalled  that  the \\n \\nPresident denied saying to Comey that he hoped Comey would let Flynn go, but added that he was “allowed \\nto hope.”  The President told McGahn he did not think he had crossed any lines.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\nFirst, Comey wrote a detailed memorandum of his encounter with the President on the \\nsame day it occurred.  Comey also told senior FBI officials about the meeting with the President \\nthat day, and their recollections of what Comey told them at the time are consistent with Comey’s \\naccount.271 \\n\\n     \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nSecond, Comey provided testimony about the President’s request that he “let[] Flynn go” \\nunder oath in congressional proceedings and in interviews with federal investigators subject to \\npenalties for lying under 18 U.S.C. § 1001.  Comey’s recollections of the encounter have remained \\nconsistent over time. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThird, the objective, corroborated circumstances of how the one-on-one meeting came to \\n \\noccur support Comey’s description of the event.  Comey recalled that the President cleared the \\nroom  to  speak  with  Comey  alone  after  a  homeland  security  briefing  in  the  Oval  Office,  that  \\nKushner and Sessions lingered and had to be shooed out by the President, and that Priebus briefly \\nopened  the  door  during  the  meeting,  prompting  the  President  to  wave  him  away.    While  the \\n \\nPresident has publicly denied those details, other Administration officials who were present have \\nconfirmed Comey’s account of how he ended up in a one-on-one meeting with the President.272 \\n  \\nAnd the President acknowledged to Priebus and McGahn that he in fact spoke to Comey about \\nFlynn in their one-on-one meeting. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nFourth, the President’s decision to clear the room and, in particular, to exclude the Attorney \\nGeneral from the meeting signals that the President wanted to be alone with Comey, which is \\nconsistent  with  the  delivery  of  a  message  of  the  type  that  Comey  recalls,  rather  than  a  more \\ninnocuous conversation that could have occurred in the presence of the Attorney General.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nFinally, Comey’s reaction to the President’s statements is consistent with the President \\n \\nhaving asked him to “let[] Flynn go.”  Comey met with the FBI leadership team, which agreed to \\nkeep the President’s statements closely held and not to inform the team working on the Flynn \\ninvestigation so that they would not be influenced by the President’s request. Comey also promptly \\nmet with the Attorney General to ask him not to be left alone with the President again, an account \\nverified by Sessions, FBI Chief of Staff James Rybicki, and Jody Hunt, who was then the Attorney \\nGeneral’s chief of staff. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nA second question is whether the President’s statements, which were not phrased as a direct \\norder  to  Comey,  could  impede  or  interfere  with  the  FBI’s  investigation  of  Flynn.  While  the \\nPresident said he “hope[d]” Comey could “let[] Flynn go,” rather than affirmatively directing him \\n \\nto do so, the circumstances of the conversation show that the President was asking Comey to close \\nthe FBI’s investigation into Flynn.  First, the President arranged the meeting with Comey so that \\n \\nthey  would  be  alone  and  purposely  excluded  the  Attorney  General,  which  suggests  that  the \\n \\nPresident meant to make a request to Comey that he did not want anyone else to hear.  Second, \\n \\nbecause  the  President  is  the  head  of  the  Executive  Branch,  when  he  says  that  he  “hopes”  a \\nsubordinate will do something, it is reasonable to expect that the subordinate will do what the \\nPresident wants.  Indeed, the President repeated a version of “let this go” three times, and Comey \\n                                            \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n271 Rybicki 11/21/18 302, at 4; McCabe 8/17/17 302, at 13-14.  \\n \\n272 See Priebus 10/13/17 302, at 18; Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 6.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n45 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\ntestified that he understood the President’s statements as a directive, which is corroborated by the \\nway Comey reacted at the time.   \\n\\nb. \\n\\nNexus to a proceeding.  To establish a nexus to a proceeding, it would be necessary \\n \\nto  show  that  the  President  could  reasonably  foresee  and  actually  contemplated  that  the \\n \\ninvestigation of Flynn was likely to lead to a grand jury investigation or prosecution.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAt the time of the President’s one-on-one meeting with Comey, no grand jury subpoenas \\n \\nhad been issued as part of the FBI’s investigation into Flynn.  But Flynn’s lies to the FBI violated \\nfederal  criminal  law, \\n,  and  resulted  in  Flynn’s \\nprosecution for violating 18 U.S.C. § 1001.  By the time the President spoke to Comey about \\n \\nFlynn, DOJ officials had informed McGahn, who informed the President, that Flynn’s statements \\n \\nto senior White House officials about his contacts with Kislyak were not true and that Flynn had \\ntold the same version of events to the FBI.  McGahn also informed the President that Flynn’s \\n \\nconduct could violate 18 U.S.C. § 1001.  After the Vice President and senior White House officials \\nreviewed the underlying information about Flynn’s calls on February 10, 2017, they believed that \\nFlynn could not have forgotten his conversations with Kislyak and concluded that he had been \\nlying.  In addition, the President’s instruction to the FBI Director to “let[] Flynn go” suggests his \\nawareness that Flynn could face criminal exposure for his conduct and was at risk of prosecution. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nc. \\n\\nIntent.  As  part  of  our  investigation,  we  examined  whether  the  President  had  a \\n \\n \\npersonal stake in the outcome of an investigation into Flynn—for example, whether the President \\n \\nwas aware of Flynn’s communications with Kislyak close in time to when they occurred, such that \\nthe President knew that Flynn had lied to senior White House officials and that those lies had been \\npassed on to the public.  Some evidence suggests that the President knew about the existence and \\ncontent of Flynn’s calls when they occurred, but the evidence is inconclusive and could not be \\nrelied upon to establish the President’s knowledge.  In advance of Flynn’s initial call with Kislyak, \\nthe President attended a meeting where the sanctions were discussed and an advisor may have \\nmentioned that Flynn was scheduled to talk to Kislyak.  Flynn told McFarland about the substance \\nof his calls with Kislyak and said they may have made a difference in Russia’s response, and Flynn \\nrecalled talking to Bannon in early January 2017 about how they had successfully “stopped the \\ntrain on Russia’s response” to the sanctions.  It would have been reasonable for Flynn to have \\nwanted the President to know of his communications with Kislyak because Kislyak told Flynn his \\nrequest had been received at the highest levels in Russia and that Russia had chosen not to retaliate \\nin response to the request, and the President was pleased by the Russian response, calling it a \\n \\n“[g]reat move.”  And the President never said publicly or internally that Flynn had lied to him \\nabout the calls with Kislyak.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nBut McFarland did not recall providing the President-Elect with Flynn’s read-out of his \\ncalls with Kislyak, and Flynn does not have a specific recollection of telling the President-Elect \\ndirectly about the calls.  Bannon also said he did not recall hearing about the calls from Flynn. \\nAnd in February 2017, the President asked Flynn what was discussed on the calls and whether he \\nhad  lied  to  the  Vice  President,  suggesting  that  he  did  not  already  know.  Our  investigation \\naccordingly  did  not  produce  evidence  that  established  that  the  President  knew  about  Flynn’s \\ndiscussions  of  sanctions  before  the  Department  of  Justice  notified  the  White  House  of  those \\n \\ndiscussions  in  late  January  2017.  The  evidence  also  does  not  establish  that  Flynn  otherwise \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n46 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)Grand Jury\\x0c \\n\\npossessed information damaging to the President that would give the President a personal incentive \\n \\nto end the FBI’s inquiry into Flynn’s conduct. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nEvidence does establish that the President connected the Flynn investigation to the FBI’s \\n \\nbroader Russia investigation and that he believed, as he told Christie, that terminating Flynn would \\nend “the whole Russia thing.”  Flynn’s firing occurred at a time when the media and Congress \\nwere raising questions about Russia’s interference in the election and whether members of the \\nPresident’s campaign had colluded with Russia.  Multiple witnesses recalled that the President \\nviewed the Russia investigations as a challenge to the legitimacy of his election.  The President \\npaid careful attention to negative coverage of Flynn and reacted with annoyance and anger when \\nthe story broke disclosing that Flynn had discussed sanctions with Kislyak.  Just hours before \\nmeeting one-on-one with Comey, the President told Christie that firing Flynn would put an end to \\nthe Russia inquiries.  And after Christie pushed back, telling the President that firing Flynn would \\nnot end the Russia investigation, the President asked Christie to reach out to Comey and convey \\nthat the President liked him and he was part of “the team.”  That afternoon, the President cleared \\n \\nthe room and asked Comey to “let[] Flynn go.” \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nWe also sought evidence relevant to assessing whether the President’s direction to Comey \\n \\nwas  motivated  by  sympathy  towards  Flynn. \\nIn  public  statements  the  President  repeatedly \\n \\ndescribed  Flynn  as  a  good  person  who  had  been  harmed  by  the  Russia  investigation,  and  the \\nPresident  directed  advisors  to  reach  out  to  Flynn  to  tell  him  the  President  “care[d]” \\nabout him and felt bad for him.  At the same time, multiple senior advisors, including Bannon, \\nPriebus, and Hicks, said that the President had become unhappy with Flynn well before Flynn was \\nforced to resign and that the President was frequently irritated with Flynn.  Priebus said he believed \\nthe President’s initial reluctance to fire Flynn stemmed not from personal regard, but from concern \\nabout the negative press that would be generated by firing the National Security Advisor so early \\nin  the  Administration.  And  Priebus  indicated  that  the  President’s  post-firing  expressions  of \\nsupport for Flynn were motivated by the President’s desire to keep Flynn from saying negative \\n \\nthings about him.   \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe way in which the President communicated the request to Comey also is relevant to \\nunderstanding the President’s intent.  When the President first learned about the FBI investigation \\ninto Flynn, he told McGahn, Bannon, and Priebus not to discuss the matter with anyone else in the \\nWhite House.  The next day, the President invited Comey for a one-on-one dinner against the \\nadvice of an aide who recommended that other White House officials also attend.  At the dinner, \\nthe President asked Comey for “loyalty” and, at a different point in the conversation, mentioned \\nthat  Flynn  had  judgment  issues.  When  the  President  met  with  Comey  the  day  after  Flynn’s \\ntermination—shortly  after  being  told  by  Christie  that  firing  Flynn  would  not  end  the  Russia \\ninvestigation—the President cleared the room, even excluding the Attorney General, so that he \\ncould again speak to Comey alone.  The President’s decision to meet one-on-one with Comey \\ncontravened the advice of the White House Counsel that the President should not communicate \\ndirectly with the Department of Justice to avoid any appearance of interfering in law enforcement \\nactivities. And the President later denied that he cleared the room and asked Comey to “let[] Flynn \\n \\ngo”—a denial that would have been unnecessary if he believed his request was a proper exercise \\nof prosecutorial discretion. \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n47 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFinally, the President’s effort to have McFarland write an internal email denying that the \\nPresident had directed Flynn to discuss sanctions with Kislyak highlights the President’s concern \\n \\nabout being associated with Flynn’s conduct.  The evidence does not establish that the President \\nwas trying to have McFarland lie.  The President’s request, however, was sufficiently irregular \\nthat McFarland—who did not know the full extent of Flynn’s communications with the President \\nand thus could not make the representation the President wanted—felt the need to draft an internal \\nmemorandum documenting the President’s request, and Eisenberg was concerned that the request \\nwould look like a quid pro quo in exchange for an ambassadorship. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nC. \\n \\n\\nThe  President’s  Reaction  to  Public  Confirmation  of  the  FBI’s  Russia \\nInvestigation  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nOverview \\n\\n \\n\\nIn early March 2017, the President learned that Sessions was considering recusing from \\n \\nthe Russia investigation and tried to prevent the recusal.  After Sessions announced his recusal on \\nMarch  2,  the  President  expressed  anger  at  Sessions  for  the  decision  and  then  privately  asked \\nSessions to “unrecuse.”  On March 20, 2017, Comey publicly disclosed the existence of the FBI’s \\n \\nRussia  investigation. \\nIn  the  days  that  followed,  the  President  contacted  Comey  and  other \\nintelligence  agency  leaders  and  asked  them  to  push  back  publicly  on  the  suggestion  that  the \\nPresident had any connection to the Russian election-interference effort in order to “lift the cloud” \\nof the ongoing investigation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nEvidence \\n\\n1.  Attorney General Sessions Recuses From the Russia Investigation \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIn late February 2017, the Department of Justice began an internal analysis of whether \\n \\nSessions  should  recuse  from  the  Russia  investigation  based  on  his  role  in  the  2016  Trump \\nCampaign.273  On March 1, 2017, the press reported that, in his January confirmation hearing to \\nbecome Attorney General, Senator Sessions had not disclosed two meetings he had with Russian \\nAmbassador Kislyak before the presidential election, leading to congressional calls for Sessions \\n   \\nto recuse or for a special counsel to investigate Russia’s interference in the presidential election.274 \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nAlso on March 1, the President called Comey and said he wanted to check in and see how \\nComey was doing.275  According to an email Comey sent to his chief of staff after the call, the \\n \\nPresident “talked about Sessions a bit,” said that he had heard Comey was “doing great,” and said \\n \\nthat he hoped Comey would come by to say hello when he was at the White House.276  Comey \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                            \\n\\n273 Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 1; Hunt 2/1/18 302, at 3. \\n274 E.g., Adam Entous et al., Sessions met with Russian envoy twice last year, encounters he later \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\ndid not disclose, Washington Post (Mar. 1, 2017). \\n \\n\\n275 3/1/17 Email, Comey to Rybicki; SCR012b_000030 (President’s Daily Diary, 3/1/17, reflecting \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\ncall with Comey at 11:55 am.) \\n\\n276  3/1/17  Email,  Comey  to  Rybicki;  see  Hearing  on  Russian  Election  Interference  Before  the \\n \\nSenate Select Intelligence Committee, 115th Cong.

According to senior ODNI official Michael \\nDempsey, Coats said after the meeting that the President had brought up the Russia investigation \\nand asked him to contact Comey to see if there was a way to get past the investigation, get it over \\nwith,  end  it,  or  words  to  that  effect.339    Dempsey  said  that  Coats  described  the  President’s \\n \\ncomments as falling “somewhere between musing about hating the investigation” and wanting \\n \\nCoats to “do something to stop it.”340  Dempsey said Coats made it clear that he would not get \\ninvolved with an ongoing FBI investigation.341  Edward Gistaro, another ODNI official, recalled \\n \\n                                            \\n\\n331  SC_AD_00210 (Donaldson 3/21/17 Notes); McGahn 12/12/17 302, at 7; Donaldson 11/6/17 \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n302, at 19.  \\n \\n\\n332 McGahn 12/12/17 302, at 7; Burnham 11/03/17 302, at 11. \\n \\n333 Boente 1/31/18 302, at 3. \\n \\n334 Coats 6/14/17 302, at 3; Culver 6/14/17 302, at 2. \\n \\n335 Coats 6/14/17 302, at 3. \\n \\n336 Coats 6/14/17 302, at 3. \\n \\n \\n337 Pompeo 6/28/17 302, at 1-3. \\n \\n338 Coats 6/14/17 302, at 3. \\n \\n339 Dempsey 6/14/17 302, at 2. \\n340 Dempsey 6/14/17 302, at 2-3. \\n \\n341 Dempsey 6/14/17 302, at 3. \\n\\n \\n\\n55 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

The  evidence  shows  that,  after  Comey’s  March  20,  2017 \\ntestimony, the President repeatedly reached out to intelligence agency leaders to discuss the FBI’s \\n \\ninvestigation.  But witnesses had different recollections of the precise content of those outreaches.  \\nSome ODNI officials recalled that Coats told them immediately after the March 22 Oval Office \\n \\nmeeting that the President asked Coats to intervene with Comey and “stop” the investigation.  But \\nthe first-hand witnesses to the encounter remember the conversation differently.  Pompeo had no \\nmemory of the specific meeting, but generally recalled the President urging officials to get the \\nword out that the President had not done anything wrong related to Russia.  Coats recalled that the \\n \\nPresident asked that Coats state publicly that no link existed between the President and Russia, but \\ndid not ask him to speak with Comey or to help end the investigation.  The other outreaches by the \\nPresident during this period were similar in nature.  The President asked Rogers if he could do \\nanything to refute the stories linking the President to Russia, and the President asked Comey to \\nmake a public statement that would “lift the cloud” of the ongoing investigation by making clear \\nthat the President was not personally under investigation.  These requests, while significant enough \\nthat Rogers thought it important to document the encounter in a written memorandum, were not \\ninterpreted  by  the  officials  who  received  them  as  directives  to  improperly  interfere  with  the \\ninvestigation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nb. \\n\\nNexus to a proceeding.  At the time of the President’s outreaches to leaders of the \\nintelligence agencies in late March and early April 2017, the FBI’s Russia investigation did not \\nyet involve grand jury proceedings.  The outreaches, however, came after and were in response to \\nComey’s March 20, 2017 announcement that the FBI, as a part of its counterintelligence mission, \\nwas  conducting  an  investigation  into  Russian  interference  in  the  2016  presidential  election. \\n  \\nComey testified that the investigation included any links or coordination with Trump campaign \\nofficials and would “include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.”    \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\nc. \\n\\nIntent.  As described above, the evidence does not establish that the President asked \\n \\nor directed intelligence agency leaders to stop or interfere with the FBI’s Russia investigation— \\nand  the  President  affirmatively  told  Comey  that  if  “some  satellite”  was  involved  in  Russian \\nelection interference “it would be good to find that out.”  But the President’s intent in trying to \\nprevent Sessions’s recusal, and in reaching out to Coats, Pompeo, Rogers, and Comey following \\n                                            \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n380 McGahn 12/12/17 302, at 9-10. \\n \\n381 Boente 1/31/18 302, at 7; McGahn 12/12/17 302, at 9. \\n \\n382 Boente 1/31/18 302, at 7. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n60 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\nComey’s  public  announcement  of  the  FBI’s  Russia  investigation,  is  nevertheless  relevant  to \\n \\nunderstanding what motivated the President’s other actions towards the investigation. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  evidence  shows  that  the  President  was  focused  on  the  Russia  investigation’s \\n \\nimplications for his presidency—and, specifically, on dispelling any suggestion that he was under \\ninvestigation or had links to Russia.  In early March, the President attempted to prevent Sessions’s \\nrecusal, even after being told that Sessions was following DOJ conflict-of-interest rules.  After \\n \\nSessions recused, the White House Counsel’s Office tried to cut off further contact with Sessions \\nabout the matter, although it is not clear whether that direction was conveyed to the President.  The \\nPresident continued to raise the issue of Sessions’s recusal and, when he had the opportunity, he \\npulled Sessions aside and urged him to unrecuse.  The President also told advisors that he wanted \\nan  Attorney General  who  would  protect  him,  the  way  he perceived Robert  Kennedy  and  Eric \\nHolder to have protected their presidents. The President made statements about being able to direct \\n \\nthe course of criminal investigations, saying words to the effect of, “You’re telling me that Bobby \\nand Jack didn’t talk about investigations?  Or Obama didn’t tell Eric Holder who to investigate?”    \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAfter Comey publicly confirmed the existence of the FBI’s Russia investigation on March \\n20, 2017, the President was “beside himself” and expressed anger that Comey did not issue a \\n \\nstatement correcting any misperception that the President himself was under investigation.  The \\nPresident  sought  to  speak  with  Acting  Attorney  General  Boente  directly  and  told  McGahn  to \\ncontact Boente to request that Comey make a clarifying statement.  The President then asked other \\nintelligence  community  leaders  to  make  public  statements  to  refute  the  suggestion  that  the \\nPresident had links to Russia, but the leaders told him they could not publicly comment on the \\ninvestigation.  On March 30 and April 11, against the advice of White House advisors who had \\ninformed him that any direct contact with the FBI could be perceived as improper interference in \\nan ongoing investigation, the President made personal outreaches to Comey asking him to “lift the \\n \\ncloud” of the Russia investigation by making public the fact that the President was not personally \\nunder investigation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nEvidence  indicates  that  the  President  was  angered  by  both  the  existence  of  the  Russia \\ninvestigation and the public reporting that he was under investigation, which he knew was not true \\nbased on Comey’s representations.  The President complained to advisors that if people thought \\nRussia helped him with the election, it would detract from what he had accomplished. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nOther evidence indicates that the President was concerned about the impact of the Russia \\n \\ninvestigation on his ability to govern.  The President complained that the perception that he was \\n \\nunder investigation was hurting his ability to conduct foreign relations, particularly with Russia.  \\nThe President told Coats he “can’t do anything with Russia,” he told Rogers that “the thing with \\nthe Russians” was interfering with his ability to conduct foreign affairs, and he told Comey that \\n \\n“he was trying to run the country and the cloud of this Russia business was making that difficult.” \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n61 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

Leading up to that \\ntestimony, the President continued to tell advisors that he wanted Comey to make public that the \\nPresident was not under investigation.  At the hearing, Comey declined to answer questions about \\n \\nthe scope or subjects of the Russia investigation and did not state publicly that the President was \\nnot under investigation.  Two days later, on May 5, 2017, the President told close aides he was \\n \\ngoing to fire Comey, and on May 9, he did so, using his official termination letter to make public \\nthat Comey had on three occasions informed the President that he was not under investigation.  \\nThe  President  decided  to  fire  Comey  before  receiving  advice  or  a  recommendation  from  the \\nDepartment of Justice, but he approved an initial public account of the termination that attributed \\nit to a recommendation from the Department of Justice based on Comey’s handling of the Clinton \\nemail investigation.  After Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein resisted attributing the firing \\nto his recommendation, the President acknowledged that he intended to fire Comey regardless of \\nthe DOJ recommendation and was thinking of the Russia investigation when he made the decision.  \\nThe President also told the Russian Foreign Minister, “I just fired the head of the F.B.I.

The President told Holt, “I was \\ngoing to fire regardless of recommendation . . . .  [Rosenstein] made a recommendation.  But \\nregardless of recommendation, I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do \\nit.”488  The President continued, “And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself—I said, \\n \\nyou know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.  It’s an excuse by the \\n \\nDemocrats for having lost an election that they should’ve won.”489 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\nIn  response  to  a  question  about  whether  he  was  angry  with  Comey  about  the  Russia \\ninvestigation, the President said, “As far as I’m concerned, I want that thing to be absolutely done \\nproperly.”490  The President added that he realized his termination of Comey “probably maybe will \\nconfuse people” with the result that it “might even lengthen out the investigation,” but he “ha[d] \\n  \\nto do the right thing for the American people” and Comey was “the wrong man for that position.”491 \\nThe President described Comey as “a showboat” and “a grandstander,” said that “[t]he FBI has \\n \\nbeen  in  turmoil,”  and  said  he  wanted  “to  have  a  really  competent,  capable  director.”492    The \\n \\nPresident affirmed that he expected the new FBI director to continue the Russia investigation.493 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nOn  the  evening  of  May  11,  2017,  following  the  Lester  Holt  interview,  the  President \\ntweeted, “Russia must be laughing up their sleeves watching as the U.S. tears itself apart over a \\nDemocrat  EXCUSE  for  losing  the  election.”494  The  same  day,  the  media  reported  that  the \\nPresident had demanded that Comey pledge his loyalty to the President in a private dinner shortly \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                            \\n\\n484  McGahn 12/12/17 302, at 16-17; Donaldson 11/6/17 302, at 26; see Dhillon 11/21/17 302, at \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n11. \\n\\n \\n\\n485 Donaldson 11/6/17 302, at 27. \\n \\n486 McGahn 12/12/17 302, at 17. \\n \\n487 Dhillon 11/21/17 302, at 11. \\n \\n488 Interview with President Donald Trump, NBC (May 11, 2017) Transcript, at 2. \\n \\n489 Interview with President Donald Trump, NBC (May 11, 2017) Transcript, at 2. \\n490 Interview with President Donald Trump, NBC (May 11, 2017) Transcript, at 3. \\n491 Interview with President Donald Trump, NBC (May 11, 2017) Transcript, at 3. \\n \\n492 Interview with President Donald Trump, NBC (May 11, 2017) Transcript, at 1, 5. \\n493 Interview with President Donald Trump, NBC (May 11, 2017) Transcript, at 7. \\n494 @realDonaldTrump 5/11/17 (4:34 p.m. ET) Tweet. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n73 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n  \\n\\nafter being sworn in.495  Late in the morning of May 12, 2017, the President tweeted, “Again, the \\nstory that there was collusion between the Russians & Trump campaign was fabricated by Dems \\n \\nas an excuse for losing the election.”496  The President also tweeted, “James Comey better hope \\nthat there are no ‘tapes’ of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!” and “When \\nJames Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there \\nis no collusion, when does it end?”497 \\n   \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nAnalysis \\n\\nIn analyzing the President’s decision to fire Comey, the following evidence is relevant to \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nthe elements of obstruction of justice: \\n\\na. \\n\\n \\nObstructive act.  The act of firing Comey removed the individual overseeing the \\nFBI’s  Russia  investigation.  The  President  knew  that  Comey  was  personally  involved  in  the \\ninvestigation based on Comey’s briefing of the Gang of Eight, Comey’s March 20, 2017 public \\ntestimony about the investigation, and the President’s one-on-one conversations with Comey.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFiring Comey would qualify as an obstructive act if it had the natural and probable effect \\nof interfering with or impeding the investigation—for example, if the termination would have the \\neffect of delaying or disrupting the investigation or providing the President with the opportunity \\nto appoint a director who would take a different approach to the investigation that the President \\nperceived as more protective of his personal interests.  Relevant circumstances bearing on that \\n \\nissue include whether the President’s actions had the potential to discourage a successor director \\nor other law enforcement officials in their conduct of the Russia investigation.  The President fired \\nComey abruptly without offering him an opportunity to resign, banned him from the FBI building, \\n \\nand criticized him publicly, calling him a “showboat” and claiming that the FBI was “in turmoil” \\n \\nunder his leadership.  And the President followed the termination with public statements that were \\nhighly  critical  of  the  investigation;  for  example,  three  days  after  firing  Comey,  the  President \\nreferred to the investigation as a “witch hunt” and asked, “when does it end?”  Those actions had \\nthe potential to affect a successor director’s conduct of the investigation. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nThe anticipated effect of removing the FBI director, however, would not necessarily be to \\nprevent  or  impede  the  FBI  from  continuing  its  investigation.  As  a  general  matter,  FBI \\n  \\ninvestigations run under the operational direction of FBI personnel levels below the FBI director. \\nBannon made a similar point when he told the President that he could fire the FBI director, but \\n \\ncould not fire the FBI.  The White House issued a press statement the day after Comey was fired \\n \\nthat  said,  “The  investigation  would  have  always  continued,  and  obviously,  the  termination  of \\n \\nComey would not have ended it.”  In addition, in his May 11 interview with Lester Holt, the \\nPresident stated that he understood when he made the decision to fire Comey that the action might \\nprolong the investigation.  And the President chose McCabe to serve as interim director, even \\n                                            \\n\\n495 Michael S. Schmidt, In a Private Dinner, Trump Demanded Loyalty.

The nexus element would be satisfied by evidence showing \\nthat  a  grand  jury  proceeding  or  criminal  prosecution  arising  from  an  FBI  investigation  was \\n \\nobjectively foreseeable and actually contemplated by the President when he terminated Comey. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSeveral facts would be relevant to such a showing.  At the time the President fired Comey, \\n \\na grand jury had not begun to hear evidence related to the Russia investigation and no grand jury \\nsubpoenas had been issued.  On March 20, 2017, however, Comey had announced that the FBI \\nwas investigating Russia’s interference in the election, including “an assessment of whether any \\ncrimes were committed.”  It was widely known that the FBI, as part of the Russia investigation, \\n \\nwas investigating the hacking of the DNC’s computers—a clear criminal offense.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIn addition, at the time the President fired Comey, evidence indicates the President knew \\nthat Flynn was still under criminal investigation and could potentially be prosecuted, despite the \\nPresident’s February 14, 2017 request that Comey “let[] Flynn go.”  On March 5, 2017, the White \\nHouse  Counsel’s  Office  was  informed  that  the  FBI  was  asking  for  transition-period  records \\nrelating to Flynn—indicating that the FBI was still actively investigating him.  The same day, the \\nPresident told advisors he wanted to call Dana Boente, then the Acting Attorney General for the \\n \\nRussia investigation, to find out whether the White House or the President was being investigated. \\n  \\nOn March 31, 2017, the President signaled his awareness that Flynn remained in legal jeopardy by \\ntweeting that “Mike Flynn should ask for immunity” before he agreed to provide testimony to the \\nFBI or Congress.  And in late March or early April, the President asked McFarland to pass a \\nmessage to Flynn telling him that the President felt bad for him and that he should stay strong, \\nfurther demonstrating the President’s awareness of Flynn’s criminal exposure.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n   \\n\\nc. \\n\\nIntent.  Substantial evidence indicates that the catalyst for the President’s decision \\n \\nto fire Comey was Comey’s unwillingness to publicly state that the President was not personally \\n \\nunder  investigation,  despite  the  President’s  repeated  requests  that  Comey  make  such  an \\n \\nannouncement.  In the week leading up to Comey’s May 3, 2017 Senate Judiciary Committee \\n \\ntestimony, the President told McGahn that it would be the last straw if Comey did not set the record \\n \\nstraight and publicly announce that the President was not under investigation.  But during his May \\n3  testimony,  Comey  refused  to  answer  questions  about  whether  the  President  was  being \\ninvestigated.  Comey’s  refusal  angered  the  President,  who  criticized  Sessions  for  leaving  him \\n \\nisolated  and  exposed,  saying  “You  left  me  on  an  island.”  Two  days  later,  the  President  told \\nadvisors he had decided to fire Comey and dictated a letter to Stephen Miller that began with a \\n \\nreference to the fact that the President was not being investigated: “While I greatly appreciate you \\n \\ninforming me that I am not under investigation concerning what I have often stated is a fabricated \\n \\nstory on a Trump-Russia relationship . . . .”  The President later asked Rosenstein to include \\n“Russia” in his memorandum and to say that Comey had told the President that he was not under \\ninvestigation.  And the President’s final termination letter included a sentence, at the President’s \\ninsistence  and  against  McGahn’s  advice,  stating  that  Comey  had  told  the  President  on  three \\nseparate occasions that he was not under investigation. \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe President’s other stated rationales for why he fired Comey are not similarly supported \\nby the evidence.  The termination letter the President and Stephen Miller prepared in Bedminster \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n75 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\ncited Comey’s handling of the Clinton email investigation, and the President told McCabe he fired \\nComey  for  that  reason.  But  the  facts  surrounding  Comey’s  handling  of  the  Clinton  email \\ninvestigation were well known to the President at the time he assumed office, and the President \\nhad made it clear to both Comey and the President’s senior staff in early 2017 that he wanted \\nComey to stay on as director.  And Rosenstein articulated his criticism of Comey’s handling of the \\nClinton investigation after the President had already decided to fire Comey.  The President’s draft \\ntermination letter also stated that morale in the FBI was at an all-time low and Sanders told the \\npress after Comey’s termination that the White House had heard from “countless” FBI agents who \\nhad lost confidence in Comey.  But the evidence does not support those claims.  The President told \\nComey  at  their  January  27  dinner  that  “the  people  of  the  FBI  really like  [him],”  no  evidence \\nsuggests  that  the  President  heard  otherwise  before  deciding  to  terminate  Comey,  and  Sanders \\nacknowledged to investigators that her comments were not founded on anything.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nWe also considered why it was important to the President that Comey announce publicly \\nthat he was not under investigation.  Some evidence indicates that the President believed that the \\nerroneous  perception  he  was  under  investigation  harmed  his  ability  to  manage  domestic  and \\nforeign affairs, particularly in dealings with Russia.  The President told Comey that the “cloud” of \\n“this Russia business” was making it difficult to run the country.  The President told Sessions and \\nMcGahn that foreign leaders had expressed sympathy to him for being under investigation and that \\nthe perception he was under investigation was hurting his ability to address foreign relations issues.  \\nThe President complained to Rogers that “the thing with the Russians [was] messing up” his ability \\nto get things done with Russia, and told Coats, “I can’t do anything with Russia, there’s things I’d \\nlike to do with Russia, with trade, with ISIS, they’re all over me with this.”  The President also \\n \\nmay have viewed Comey as insubordinate for his failure to make clear in the May 3 testimony that \\nthe President was not under investigation.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nOther evidence, however, indicates that the President wanted to protect himself from an \\ninvestigation into his campaign.  The day after learning about the FBI’s interview of Flynn, the \\nPresident had a one-on-one dinner with Comey, against the advice of senior aides, and told Comey \\nhe needed Comey’s “loyalty.”  When the President later asked Comey for a second time to make \\n \\npublic that he was not under investigation, he brought up loyalty again, saying “Because I have \\n \\nbeen very loyal to you, very loyal, we had that thing, you know.”  After the President learned of \\nSessions’s recusal from the Russia investigation, the President was furious and said he wanted an \\nAttorney General who would protect him the way he perceived Robert Kennedy and Eric Holder \\nto have protected their presidents.  The President also said he wanted to be able to tell his Attorney \\n \\nGeneral “who to investigate.”      \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIn addition, the President had a motive to put the FBI’s Russia investigation behind him.  \\n \\nThe  evidence  does  not  establish  that  the  termination  of  Comey  was  designed  to  cover  up  a \\nconspiracy between the Trump Campaign and Russia:  As described in Volume I, the evidence \\nuncovered  in  the  investigation  did  not  establish  that  the  President  or  those  close  to  him  were \\n \\ninvolved  in  the  charged  Russian  computer-hacking  or  active-measure  conspiracies,  or  that  the \\nPresident otherwise had an unlawful relationship with any Russian official.  But the evidence does \\nindicate  that  a  thorough  FBI  investigation  would  uncover  facts  about  the  campaign  and  the \\nPresident personally that the President could have understood to be crimes or that would give rise \\nto personal and political concerns.  Although the President publicly stated during and after the \\n \\nelection that he had no connection to Russia, the Trump Organization, through Michael Cohen, \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n76 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

In  the  immediate  aftermath  of  the  firing,  the \\nPresident  dictated  a  press  statement  suggesting  that  he  had  acted  based  on  the  DOJ \\nrecommendations, and White House press officials repeated that story.  But the President had \\ndecided to fire Comey before the White House solicited those recommendations.   Although the \\nPresident ultimately acknowledged that he was going to fire Comey regardless of the Department \\nof Justice’s recommendations, he did so only after DOJ officials made clear to him that they would \\nresist  the  White  House’s  suggestion  that  they  had  prompted  the  process  that  led  to  Comey’s \\ntermination.  The initial reliance on a pretextual justification could support an inference that the \\nPresident had concerns about providing the real reason for the firing, although the evidence does \\nnot resolve whether those concerns were personal, political, or both. \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nE. \\n\\nThe President’s Efforts to Remove the Special Counsel \\n\\n \\nOverview \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\nThe Acting Attorney General appointed a Special Counsel on May 17, 2017, prompting \\n \\nthe President to state that it was the end of his presidency and that Attorney General Sessions had \\nfailed to protect him and should resign.  Sessions submitted his resignation, which the President \\nultimately did not accept.  The President told senior advisors that the Special Counsel had conflicts \\nof interest, but they responded that those claims were “ridiculous” and posed no obstacle to the \\n \\nSpecial Counsel’s service.  Department of Justice ethics officials similarly cleared the Special \\nCounsel’s service.  On June 14, 2017, the press reported that the President was being personally \\ninvestigated  for  obstruction  of  justice  and  the  President  responded  with  a  series  of  tweets \\n \\n                                            \\n\\n498 See Volume II, Section II.K.1, infra. \\n   \\n499 See Volume I, Section III.D.1, supra. \\n500  In addition to whether the President had a motive related to Russia-related matters that an FBI \\n \\ninvestigation could uncover, we considered whether the President’s intent in firing Comey was connected \\nto other conduct that could come to light as a result of the FBI’s Russian-interference investigation.  In \\n \\nparticular, Michael Cohen was a potential subject of investigation because of his pursuit of the Trump \\nTower  Moscow  project  and  involvement  in  other  activities.  And  facts  uncovered  in  the  Russia \\ninvestigation, which our Office referred to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New \\n \\nYork, ultimately led to the conviction of Cohen in the Southern District of New York for campaign-finance \\noffenses related to payments he said he made at the direction of the President.  See Volume II, Section \\nII.K.5, infra.  The investigation, however, did not establish that when the President fired Comey, he was \\n \\nconsidering the possibility that the FBI’s investigation would uncover these payments or that the President’s \\nintent in firing Comey was otherwise connected to a concern about these matters coming to light.       \\n\\n   \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n77 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

This \\n \\nis terrible.  This is the end of my Presidency.  I’m fucked.”504  The President became angry and \\nlambasted the Attorney General for his decision to recuse from the investigation, stating, “How \\n \\ncould you let this happen, Jeff?”505  The President said the position of Attorney General was his \\nmost  important  appointment  and  that  Sessions  had  “let  [him]  down,”  contrasting  him  to  Eric \\nHolder  and  Robert  Kennedy.506  Sessions  recalled  that  the  President  said  to  him,  “you  were \\nsupposed to protect me,” or words to that effect.507  The President returned to the consequences of \\nthe appointment and said, “Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels it ruins \\nyour presidency.

Even if the removal \\nof the lead prosecutor would not prevent the investigation from continuing under a new appointee, \\na factfinder would need to consider whether the act had the potential to delay further action in the \\ninvestigation,  chill  the  actions  of  any  replacement  Special  Counsel,  or  otherwise  impede  the \\n \\ninvestigation. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nA threshold question is whether the President in fact directed McGahn to have the Special \\nCounsel removed.  After news organizations reported that in June 2017 the President had ordered \\nMcGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the President publicly disputed these accounts, and \\nprivately told McGahn that he had simply wanted McGahn to bring conflicts of interest to the \\nDepartment of Justice’s attention.  See Volume II, Section II.I, infra.  Some of the President’s \\n \\nspecific  language  that  McGahn  recalled  from  the  calls  is  consistent  with  that  explanation. \\n  \\nSubstantial evidence, however, supports the conclusion that the President went further and in fact \\ndirected McGahn to call Rosenstein to have the Special Counsel removed. \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFirst, McGahn’s clear recollection was that the President directed him to tell Rosenstein \\n \\n \\nnot only that conflicts existed but also that “Mueller has to go.”  McGahn is a credible witness \\nwith no motive to lie or exaggerate given the position he held in the White House.601  McGahn \\n \\nspoke with the President twice and understood the directive the same way both times, making it \\nunlikely that he misheard or misinterpreted the President’s request.  In response to that request, \\nMcGahn decided to quit because he did not want to participate in events that he described as akin \\n \\nto the Saturday Night Massacre.  He called his lawyer, drove to the White House, packed up his \\noffice, prepared to submit a resignation letter with his chief of staff, told Priebus that the President \\nhad asked him to “do crazy shit,” and informed Priebus and Bannon that he was leaving.  Those \\nacts would be a highly unusual reaction to a request to convey information to the Department of \\nJustice. \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nSecond, in the days before the calls to McGahn, the President, through his counsel, had \\nalready brought the asserted conflicts to the attention of the Department of Justice.  Accordingly, \\n \\nthe President had no reason to have McGahn call Rosenstein that weekend to raise conflicts issues \\nthat already had been raised. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nThird, the President’s sense of urgency and repeated requests to McGahn to take immediate \\naction on a weekend—“You gotta do this.  You gotta call Rod.”—support McGahn’s recollection \\nthat the President wanted the Department of Justice to take action to remove the Special Counsel.  \\nHad  the  President  instead  sought  only  to  have  the  Department  of  Justice  re-examine  asserted \\n \\nconflicts to evaluate whether they posed an ethical bar, it would have been unnecessary to set the \\nprocess in motion on a Saturday and to make repeated calls to McGahn.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\nFinally, the President had discussed “knocking out Mueller” and raised conflicts of interest \\nin a May 23, 2017 call with McGahn, reflecting that the President connected the conflicts to a plan \\n \\nto remove the Special Counsel.  And in the days leading up to June 17, 2017, the President made \\n \\nclear to Priebus and Bannon, who then told Ruddy, that the President was considering terminating \\n                                            \\n\\n601 When this Office first interviewed McGahn about this topic, he was reluctant to share detailed \\ninformation about what had occurred and only did so after continued questioning.  See McGahn 12/14/17 \\n302 (agent notes). \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n88 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\nthe Special Counsel.  Also during this time period, the President reached out to Christie to get his \\nthoughts on firing the Special Counsel. This evidence shows that the President was not just seeking \\nan examination of whether conflicts existed but instead was looking to use asserted conflicts as a \\nway to terminate the Special Counsel.   \\n\\n \\n\\nb. \\n\\nNexus to an official proceeding.  To satisfy the proceeding requirement, it would \\n \\nbe necessary to establish a nexus between the President’s act of seeking to terminate the Special \\nCounsel and a pending or foreseeable grand jury proceeding. \\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\nSubstantial evidence indicates that by June 17, 2017, the President knew his conduct was \\n \\n \\nunder investigation by a federal prosecutor who could present any evidence of federal crimes to a \\n \\ngrand jury.  On May 23, 2017, McGahn explicitly warned the President that his “biggest exposure” \\nwas not his act of firing Comey but his “other contacts” and “calls,” and his “ask re: Flynn.”  By \\nearly June, it was widely reported in the media that federal prosecutors had issued grand jury \\n \\nsubpoenas  in  the  Flynn  inquiry  and  that  the  Special  Counsel  had  taken  over  the  Flynn \\ninvestigation.602  On June 9, 2017, the Special Counsel’s Office informed the White House that \\n \\ninvestigators would be interviewing intelligence agency officials who allegedly had been asked by \\nthe President to push back against the Russia investigation.  On June 14, 2017, news outlets began \\nreporting that the President was himself being investigated for obstruction of justice.  Based on \\nwidespread reporting, the President knew that such an investigation could include his request for \\n \\nComey’s loyalty; his request that Comey “let[] Flynn go”; his outreach to Coats and Rogers; and \\nhis termination of Comey and statement to the Russian Foreign Minister that the termination had \\nrelieved “great pressure” related to Russia.  And on June 16, 2017, the day before he directed \\nMcGahn  to  have  the  Special  Counsel  removed,  the  President  publicly  acknowledged  that  his \\nconduct was under investigation by a federal prosecutor, tweeting, “I am being investigated for \\nfiring the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director!”  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nc. \\n\\n \\nIntent.  Substantial evidence indicates that the President’s attempts to remove the \\nSpecial Counsel were linked to the Special Counsel’s oversight of investigations that involved the \\n \\nPresident’s conduct—and, most immediately, to reports that the President was being investigated \\nfor potential obstruction of justice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nBefore the President terminated Comey, the President considered it critically important that \\nhe was not under investigation and that the public not erroneously think he was being investigated.  \\nAs described in Volume II, Section II.D, supra, advisors perceived the President, while he was \\ndrafting the Comey termination letter, to be concerned more than anything else about getting out \\nthat he was not personally under investigation.  When the President learned of the appointment of \\n \\nthe Special Counsel on May 17, 2017, he expressed further concern about the investigation, saying \\n“[t]his is the end of my Presidency.”  The President also faulted Sessions for recusing, saying “you \\nwere supposed to protect me.”   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nOn  June  14,  2017,  when  the  Washington  Post  reported  that  the  Special  Counsel  was \\ninvestigating the President for obstruction of justice, the President was facing what he had wanted \\n                                            \\n\\n602  See, e.g., Evan Perez et  al., CNN exclusive: Grand jury subpoenas issued in FBI’s Russia \\ninvestigation, CNN (May 9, 2017); Matt Ford, Why Mueller Is Taking Over the Michael Flynn Grand Jury, \\nThe Atlantic (June 2, 2017). \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n89 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nto avoid: a criminal investigation into his own conduct that was the subject of widespread media \\nattention.  The evidence indicates that news of the obstruction investigation prompted the President \\nto call McGahn and seek to have the Special Counsel removed.  By mid-June, the Department of \\nJustice had already cleared the Special Counsel’s service and the President’s advisors had told him \\n \\nthat the claimed conflicts of interest were “silly” and did not provide a basis to remove the Special \\nCounsel.  On June 13, 2017, the Acting Attorney General testified before Congress that no good \\ncause for removing the Special Counsel existed, and the President dictated a press statement to \\n \\n \\nSanders saying he had no intention of firing the Special Counsel.  But the next day, the media \\nreported  that  the  President  was  under  investigation  for  obstruction  of  justice  and  the  Special \\nCounsel was interviewing witnesses about events related to possible obstruction—spurring the \\nPresident to write critical tweets about the Special Counsel’s investigation.  The President called \\nMcGahn at home that night and then called him on Saturday from Camp David.  The evidence \\naccordingly indicates that news that an obstruction investigation had been opened is what led the \\nPresident to call McGahn to have the Special Counsel terminated.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThere also is evidence that the President knew that he should not have made those calls to \\n \\nMcGahn.  The  President  made  the  calls  to  McGahn  after  McGahn  had  specifically  told  the \\nPresident that the White House Counsel’s Office—and McGahn himself—could not be involved \\nin pressing conflicts claims and that the President should consult with his personal counsel if he \\nwished to raise conflicts.  Instead of relying on his personal counsel to submit the conflicts claims, \\nthe President sought to use his official powers to remove the Special Counsel.  And after the media \\nreported on the President’s actions, he denied that he ever ordered McGahn to have the Special \\nCounsel terminated and made repeated efforts to have McGahn deny the story, as discussed in \\nVolume  II,  Section  II.I,  infra.  Those  denials  are  contrary  to  the  evidence  and  suggest  the \\nPresident’s awareness that the direction to McGahn could be seen as improper.  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nF. \\n\\nThe President’s Efforts to Curtail the Special Counsel Investigation \\n \\n\\n \\nOverview \\n\\nTwo days after the President directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the \\nPresident made another attempt to affect the course of the Russia investigation.  On June 19, 2017, \\nthe President met one-on-one with Corey Lewandowski in the Oval Office and dictated a message \\nto be delivered to Attorney General Sessions that would have had the effect of limiting the Russia \\ninvestigation to future election interference only.  One month later, the President met again with \\n \\nLewandowski  and  followed  up  on  the  request  to  have  Sessions  limit  the  scope  of  the  Russia \\ninvestigation.  Lewandowski told the President the message would be delivered soon.  Hours later, \\nthe President publicly criticized Sessions in an unplanned press interview, raising questions about \\nSessions’s job security. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1.

But our \\nPOTUS . . . is being treated very unfairly.  He shouldn’t have a Special Prosecutor/Counsel \\nb/c he hasn’t done anything wrong.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\nAnalysis \\n\\n \\nIn  analyzing  the  President’s  efforts  to  have  Lewandowski  deliver  a  message  directing \\n \\nSessions to publicly announce that the Special Counsel investigation would be confined to future \\nelection interference, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice: \\n\\n \\n\\na. \\n\\nObstructive  act.  The  President’s  effort  to  send  Sessions  a  message  through \\n \\nLewandowski would qualify as an obstructive act if it would naturally obstruct the investigation \\nand any grand jury proceedings that might flow from the inquiry.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  President  sought  to  have  Sessions  announce  that  the  President  “shouldn’t  have  a \\n \\n \\nSpecial Prosecutor/Counsel” and that Sessions was going to “meet with the Special Prosecutor to \\n \\nexplain this is very unfair and let the Special Prosecutor move forward with investigating election \\n \\nmeddling for future elections so that nothing can happen in future elections.” The President wanted \\n \\nSessions to disregard his recusal from the investigation, which had followed from a formal DOJ \\n \\nethics review, and have Sessions declare that he knew “for a fact” that “there were no Russians \\ninvolved with the campaign” because he “was there.”  The President further directed that Sessions \\n \\nshould explain that the President should not be subject to an investigation “because he hasn’t done \\nanything  wrong.”  Taken  together,  the  President’s  directives  indicate  that  Sessions  was  being \\ninstructed to tell the Special Counsel to end the existing investigation into the President and his \\ncampaign, with the Special Counsel being permitted to “move forward with investigating election \\nmeddling for future elections.”   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nb. \\n\\nNexus to an official proceeding.  As described above, by the time of the President’s \\n \\ninitial one-on-one meeting with Lewandowski on June 19, 2017, the existence of a grand jury \\ninvestigation  supervised  by  the  Special  Counsel  was  public  knowledge.  By  the  time  of  the \\n \\nPresident’s  follow-up  meeting  with  Lewandowski, \\n \\nSee Volume II, Section II.G, infra.  To satisfy the nexus requirement, \\nit would be necessary to show that limiting the Special Counsel’s investigation would have the \\nnatural and probable effect of impeding that grand jury proceeding. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nc. \\n\\n \\nIntent.  Substantial evidence indicates that the President’s effort to have Sessions \\nlimit the scope of the Special Counsel’s investigation to future election interference was intended \\nto prevent further investigative scrutiny of the President’s and his campaign’s conduct.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nAs previously described, see Volume II, Section II.B, supra, the President knew that the \\nRussia investigation was focused in part on his campaign, and he perceived allegations of Russian \\n \\ninterference to cast doubt on the legitimacy of his election.  The President further knew that the \\ninvestigation had broadened to include his own conduct and whether he had obstructed justice.  \\n \\nThose investigations would not proceed if the Special Counsel’s jurisdiction were limited to future \\nelection interference only. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe timing and circumstances of the President’s actions support the conclusion that he \\n \\nsought that result.  The President’s initial direction that Sessions should limit the Special Counsel’s \\ninvestigation came just two days after the President had ordered McGahn to have the Special \\nCounsel removed, which itself followed public reports that the President was personally under \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n97 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)Grand Jury\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\ninvestigation for obstruction of justice.  The sequence of those events raises an inference that after \\nseeking to terminate the Special Counsel, the President sought to exclude his and his campaign’s \\nconduct from the investigation’s scope.  The President raised the matter with Lewandowski again \\non July 19, 2017, just days after emails and information about the June 9, 2016 meeting between \\nRussians and senior campaign officials had been publicly disclosed, generating substantial media \\ncoverage and investigative interest. \\n\\n \\n\\nThe manner in which the President acted provides additional evidence of his intent.  Rather \\nthan rely on official channels, the President met with Lewandowski alone in the Oval Office.  The \\nPresident selected a loyal “devotee” outside the White House to deliver the message, supporting \\nan inference that he was working outside White House channels, including McGahn, who had \\npreviously resisted contacting the Department of Justice about the Special Counsel.  The President \\nalso did not contact the Acting Attorney General, who had just testified publicly that there was no \\n \\ncause to remove the Special Counsel.  Instead, the President tried to use Sessions to restrict and \\nredirect the Special Counsel’s investigation when Sessions was recused and could not properly \\ntake any action on it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe July 19, 2017 events provide further evidence of the President’s intent.  The President \\nfollowed up with Lewandowski in a separate one-on-one meeting one month after he first dictated \\n \\nthe message for Sessions, demonstrating he still sought to pursue the request.  And just hours after \\nLewandowski assured the President that the message would soon be delivered to Sessions, the \\nPresident gave an unplanned interview to the New York Times in which he publicly attacked \\nSessions  and  raised  questions  about  his  job  security.  Four  days  later,  on  July  22,  2017,  the \\nPresident directed Priebus to obtain Sessions’s resignation.  That evidence could raise an inference \\nthat the President wanted Sessions to realize that his job might be on the line as he evaluated \\nwhether  to  comply  with  the  President’s  direction  that  Sessions  publicly  announce  that, \\nnotwithstanding his recusal, he was going to confine the Special Counsel’s investigation to future \\nelection interference. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nG. \\n\\nThe President’s Efforts to Prevent Disclosure of Emails About the June 9, 2016 \\nMeeting Between Russians and Senior Campaign Officials \\n  \\n\\n \\nOverview \\n\\nBy June 2017, the President became aware of emails setting up the June 9, 2016 meeting \\nbetween senior campaign officials and Russians who offered derogatory information on Hillary \\nClinton as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.”  On multiple occasions \\nin late June and early July 2017, the President directed aides not to publicly disclose the emails, \\nand he then dictated a statement about the meeting to be issued by Donald Trump Jr. describing \\n \\nthe meeting as about adoption.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nEvidence \\n\\n1.

On June 29, Hicks \\nwarned the President that the emails setting up the June 9 meeting were “really bad” and the story \\nwould be “massive” when it broke, but the President told her and Kushner to “leave it alone.”  \\nEarly on July 8, after Hicks told the President the New York Times was working on a story about \\n \\nthe June 9 meeting, the President directed her not to comment, even though Hicks said that the \\nPresident usually considered not responding to the press to be the ultimate sin.  Later that day, the \\n \\nPresident rejected Trump Jr.’s draft statement that would have acknowledged that the meeting was \\nwith  “an  individual  who  I  was  told  might  have  information  helpful  to  the  campaign.”  The \\n \\nPresident then dictated a statement to Hicks that said the meeting was about Russian adoption \\n(which the President had twice been told was discussed at the meeting).  The statement dictated \\n \\nby the President did not mention the offer of derogatory information about Clinton. \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nEach of these efforts by the President involved his communications team and was directed \\nat the press.  They would amount to obstructive acts only if the President, by taking these actions, \\n \\nsought to withhold information from or mislead congressional investigators or the Special Counsel.  \\nOn May 17, 2017, the President’s campaign received a document request from SSCI that clearly \\ncovered the June 9 meeting and underlying emails, and those documents also plainly would have \\nbeen relevant to the Special Counsel’s investigation.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nBut the evidence does not establish that the President took steps to prevent the emails or \\nother  information  about  the  June  9  meeting  from  being  provided  to  Congress  or  the  Special \\nCounsel.  The series of discussions in which the President sought to limit access to the emails and \\nprevent  their  public  release  occurred  in  the  context  of  developing  a  press  strategy.  The  only \\nevidence we have of the President discussing the production of documents to Congress or the \\nSpecial  Counsel  is  the  conversation  on  June  29,  2017,  when  Hicks  recalled  the  President \\nacknowledging that Kushner’s attorney should provide emails related to the June 9 meeting to \\nwhomever he needed to give them to.  We do not have evidence of what the President discussed \\n \\n \\nwith his own lawyers at that time.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nb. \\n\\nNexus to an official proceeding.  As described above, by the time of the President’s \\n \\nattempts to prevent the public release of the emails regarding the June 9 meeting, the existence of \\na  grand  jury  investigation  supervised  by  the  Special  Counsel  was  public  knowledge,  and  the \\nPresident had been told that the emails were responsive to congressional inquiries.  To satisfy the \\nnexus requirement, however, it would be necessary to show that preventing the release of the \\n \\nemails  to  the  public  would  have  the  natural  and  probable  effect  of  impeding  the  grand  jury \\nproceeding or congressional inquiries.  As noted above, the evidence does not establish that the \\nPresident sought to prevent disclosure of the emails in those official proceedings.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nc. \\n\\nIntent.  The  evidence  establishes  the  President’s  substantial  involvement  in  the \\n \\ncommunications strategy related to information about his campaign’s connections to Russia and \\n \\nhis desire to minimize public disclosures about those connections.  The President became aware \\nof the emails no later than June 29, 2017, when he discussed them with Hicks and Kushner, and \\nhe  could  have  been  aware  of  them  as  early  as  June  2,  2017,  when  lawyers  for  the  Trump \\n \\nOrganization began interviewing witnesses who participated in the June 9 meeting.  The President \\nthereafter repeatedly rejected the advice of Hicks and other staffers to publicly release information \\nabout the June 9 meeting.  The President expressed concern that multiple people had access to the \\n \\nemails and instructed Hicks that only one lawyer should deal with the matter.  And the President \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n106 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R.

P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\ndictated a statement to be released by Trump Jr. in response to the first press accounts of the June \\n \\n9 meeting that said the meeting was about adoption. \\n\\nBut  as  described  above,  the  evidence  does  not  establish  that  the  President  intended  to \\n \\nprevent the Special Counsel’s Office or Congress from obtaining the emails setting up the June 9 \\n \\nmeeting or other information about that meeting.  The statement recorded by Corallo—that the \\nemails “will never get out”—can be explained as reflecting a belief that the emails would not be \\nmade public if the President’s press strategy were followed, even if the emails were provided to \\nCongress and the Special Counsel. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nH. \\n\\nThe President’s Further Efforts to Have the Attorney General Take Over the \\nInvestigation \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nOverview \\n\\n \\n\\nFrom  summer  2017  through  2018,  the  President  attempted  to  have  Attorney  General \\n \\nSessions  reverse  his  recusal,  take  control  of  the  Special  Counsel’s investigation, and  order  an \\ninvestigation of Hillary Clinton. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nEvidence \\n\\n1.  The President Again Seeks to Have Sessions Reverse his Recusal \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAfter  returning  Sessions’s  resignation  letter  at  the  end  of  May  2017,  but  before  the \\n \\nPresident’s July 19, 2017 New York Times interview in which he publicly criticized Sessions for \\nrecusing from the Russia investigation, the President took additional steps to have Sessions reverse \\nhis recusal.  In particular, at some point after the May 17, 2017 appointment of the Special Counsel, \\nSessions  recalled,  the  President  called  him  at  home  and  asked  if  Sessions  would  “unrecuse” \\nhimself.736  According to Sessions, the President asked him to reverse his recusal so that Sessions \\ncould direct the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute Hillary Clinton, and the “gist” \\n \\nof the conversation was that the President wanted Sessions to unrecuse from “all of it,” including \\nthe Special Counsel’s Russia investigation.737  Sessions listened but did not respond, and he did \\nnot reverse his recusal or order an investigation of Clinton.738 \\n   \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIn  early  July  2017,  the  President  asked  Staff  Secretary  Rob  Porter  what  he  thought  of \\nAssociate Attorney General Rachel Brand.739  Porter recalled that the President asked him if Brand \\n \\nwas good, tough, and “on the team.”740  The President also asked if Porter thought Brand was \\ninterested in being responsible for the Special Counsel’s investigation and whether she would want \\n                                            \\n\\n736  Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 15.  That was the second time that the President asked Sessions to \\nreverse his recusal from campaign-related investigations.

Additional Efforts to Have Sessions Unrecuse or Direct Investigations Covered \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nby his Recusal \\n\\nLater  in  2017,  the  President  continued  to  urge  Sessions  to  reverse  his  recusal  from \\n \\n \\ncampaign-related investigations and considered replacing Sessions with an Attorney General who \\n \\nwould not be recused. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n   \\n\\nOn  October  16,  2017,  the  President  met  privately  with  Sessions  and  said  that  the \\n \\n \\nDepartment of Justice was not investigating individuals and events that the President thought the \\nDepartment should be investigating.752  According to contemporaneous notes taken by Porter, who \\nwas at the meeting, the President mentioned Clinton’s emails and said, “Don’t have to tell us, just \\n \\n \\ntake  [a]  look.”753  Sessions  did  not  offer  any  assurances  or  promises  to  the  President  that  the \\nDepartment of Justice would comply with that request.754  Two days later, on October 18, 2017, \\nthe President tweeted, “Wow, FBI confirms report that James Comey drafted letter exonerating \\nCrooked Hillary Clinton long before investigation was complete.  Many people not interviewed, \\nincluding Clinton herself.  Comey stated under oath that he didn’t do this-obviously a fix?  Where \\nis  Justice  Dept?”755  On  October  29,  2017,  the  President  tweeted  that  there  was  “ANGER  & \\n \\nUNITY” over a “lack of investigation” of Clinton and “the Comey fix,” and concluded: “DO \\n \\nSOMETHING!”756 \\n\\n \\n  \\n\\n   \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\nOn December 6, 2017, five days after Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his contacts with \\nthe Russian government, the President asked to speak with Sessions in the Oval Office at the end \\n \\nof a cabinet meeting.757  During that Oval Office meeting, which Porter attended, the President \\nagain suggested that Sessions could “unrecuse,” which Porter linked to taking back supervision of \\nthe  Russia  investigation  and  directing  an  investigation  of  Hillary  Clinton.758  According  to \\ncontemporaneous notes taken by Porter, the President said, “I don’t know if you could un-recuse \\nyourself.  You’d be a hero.  Not telling you to do anything.  Dershowitz says POTUS can get \\n \\ninvolved. Can order AG to investigate. I don’t want to get involved.

While I am Attorney General, the actions \\n \\nof the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.”773  The \\nnext  day,  the  President  tweeted  a  response:  “‘Department  of  Justice  will  not  be  improperly \\ninfluenced by political considerations.’  Jeff, this is GREAT, what everyone wants, so look into \\nall of the corruption on the ‘other side’ including deleted Emails, Comey lies & leaks, Mueller \\nconflicts, McCabe, Strzok, Page, Ohr, FISA abuse, Christopher Steele & his phony and corrupt \\nDossier, the Clinton Foundation, illegal surveillance of Trump campaign, Russian collusion by \\nDems – and so much more.

Obstructive act.  To determine if the President’s efforts to have the Attorney General \\nunrecuse could qualify as an obstructive act, it would be necessary to assess evidence on whether \\nthose  actions  would  naturally  impede  the  Russia  investigation.  That  inquiry  would  take  into \\naccount the supervisory role that the Attorney General, if unrecused, would play in the Russia \\ninvestigation.  It also would have to take into account that the Attorney General’s recusal covered \\n                                            \\n(“Jeff  Sessions  should  be  ashamed  of  himself  for  allowing  this  total  HOAX  to  get  started  in  the  first \\n \\nplace!”). \\n769 @realDonaldTrump 6/5/18 (7:31 a.m. ET) Tweet. \\n770 @realDonaldTrump 8/1/18 (9:24 a.m. ET) Tweet. \\n771 Fox & Friends Interview of President Trump, Fox News (Aug. 23, 2018). \\n \\n772 Fox & Friends Interview of President Trump, Fox News (Aug. 23, 2018). \\n \\n773 Sessions 8/23/18 Press Statement. \\n774 @realDonaldTrump 8/24/18 (6:17 a.m. ET) Tweet; @ realDonaldTrump 8/24/18 (6:28 a.m. ET) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nTweet. \\n\\n775 @realDonaldTrump 11/7/18 (2:44 p.m. ET) Tweet. \\n\\n111 \\n\\n \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\nother campaign-related matters.  The inquiry would not turn on what Attorney General Sessions \\nwould actually do if unrecused, but on whether the efforts to reverse his recusal would naturally \\n \\nhave had the effect of impeding the Russia investigation.    \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nOn  multiple  occasions  in  2017,  the  President  spoke  with  Sessions  about  reversing  his \\n \\nrecusal  so  that  he  could  take  over  the  Russia  investigation  and  begin  an  investigation  and \\n \\nprosecution  of  Hillary  Clinton.  For  example,  in  early  summer  2017,  Sessions  recalled  the \\n \\nPresident asking him to unrecuse, but Sessions did not take it as a directive.  When the President \\n \\nraised the issue again in December 2017, the President said, as recorded by Porter, “Not telling \\nyou to do anything. . . .  I’m not going to get involved.  I’m not going to do anything or direct you \\nto do anything.  I just want to be treated fairly.”  The duration of the President’s efforts—which \\nspanned from March 2017 to August 2018—and the fact that the President repeatedly criticized \\nSessions in public and in private for failing to tell the President that he would have to recuse is \\nrelevant to assessing whether the President’s efforts to have Sessions unrecuse could qualify as \\nobstructive acts. \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nb.  Nexus to an official proceeding.  As described above, by mid-June 2017, the existence \\n \\nof a grand jury investigation supervised by the Special Counsel was public knowledge.  In addition, \\nin  July  2017,  a  different  grand  jury  supervised  by  the  Special  Counsel  was  empaneled  in  the \\nDistrict of Columbia, and the press reported on the existence of this grand jury in early August \\n2017.776  Whether the conduct towards the Attorney General would have a foreseeable impact on \\nthose  proceedings  turns  on  much  of  the  same  evidence  discussed  above  with  respect  to  the \\nobstructive-act element.    \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nc.  Intent.  There is evidence that at least one purpose of the President’s conduct toward \\nSessions was to have Sessions assume control over the Russia investigation and supervise it in a \\nway that would restrict its scope.  By the summer of 2017, the President was aware that the Special \\n \\nCounsel  was  investigating  him  personally  for  obstruction  of  justice.  And  in  the  wake  of  the \\n \\ndisclosures  of  emails  about  the  June  9  meeting  between  Russians  and  senior  members  of  the \\ncampaign,  see  Volume  II,  Section  II.G,  supra,  it  was  evident  that  the  investigation  into  the \\ncampaign  now  included  the  President’s  son,  son-in-law,  and  former  campaign  manager.  The \\nPresident had previously and unsuccessfully sought to have Sessions publicly announce that the \\nSpecial Counsel investigation would be confined to future election interference.  Yet Sessions \\nremained recused.  In December 2017, shortly after Flynn pleaded guilty, the President spoke to \\nSessions in the Oval Office with only Porter present and told Sessions that he would be a hero if \\nhe  unrecused.  Porter  linked  that  request  to  the  President’s  desire  that  Sessions  take  back \\nsupervision  of  the  Russia  investigation  and  direct  an  investigation  of  Hillary  Clinton.  The \\nPresident said in that meeting that he “just want[ed] to be treated fairly,” which could reflect his \\n \\nperception that it was unfair that he was being investigated while Hillary Clinton was not.  But a \\nprincipal  effect  of  that  act  would  be  to  restore  supervision  of  the  Russia  investigation  to  the \\nAttorney  General—a  position  that  the  President  frequently  suggested  should  be  occupied  by \\nsomeone like Eric Holder and Bobby Kennedy, who the President described as protecting their \\n                                            \\n\\n776 E.g., Del Quentin Wilbur & Byron Tau, Special Counsel Robert Mueller Impanels Washington \\n \\nGrand Jury in Russia Probe, Wall Street Journal (Aug. 3, 2017); Carol D. Leonnig et al., Special Counsel \\nMueller using grand jury in federal court in Washington as part of Russia investigation, Washington Post \\n(Aug. 3, 2017).    \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n112 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\npresidents.  A reasonable inference from those statements and the President’s actions is that the \\nPresident believed that an unrecused Attorney General would play a protective role and could \\nshield the President from the ongoing Russia investigation.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nI. \\n\\nThe President Orders McGahn to Deny that the President Tried to Fire the \\n \\nSpecial Counsel \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nOverview \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIn  late  January  2018,  the  media  reported  that  in  June  2017  the  President  had  ordered \\n \\n \\nMcGahn to have the Special Counsel fired based on purported conflicts of interest but McGahn \\nhad  refused,  saying  he  would  quit  instead.  After  the  story  broke,  the  President,  through  his \\npersonal counsel and two aides, sought to have McGahn deny that he had been directed to remove \\nthe Special Counsel.  Each time he was approached, McGahn responded that he would not refute \\nthe press accounts because they were accurate in reporting on the President’s effort to have the \\nSpecial Counsel removed.  The President later personally met with McGahn in the Oval Office \\nwith only the Chief of Staff present and tried to get McGahn to say that the President never ordered \\nhim to fire the Special Counsel.  McGahn refused and insisted his memory of the President’s \\ndirection  to  remove  the  Special  Counsel  was  accurate.  In  that  same  meeting,  the  President \\nchallenged McGahn for taking notes of his discussions with the President and asked why he had \\n \\ntold Special Counsel investigators that he had been directed to have the Special Counsel removed. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nEvidence \\n\\n1.

There  are  conflicts.  \\n \\nMueller has to go.”818  The President asked McGahn whether he would “do a correction,” and \\n \\nMcGahn said no.819  McGahn thought the President was testing his mettle to see how committed \\n \\nMcGahn was to what happened.820  Kelly described the meeting as “a little tense.”821 \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nThe President also asked McGahn in the meeting why he had told Special Counsel’s Office \\n \\ninvestigators that the President had told him to have the Special Counsel removed.822  McGahn \\nresponded  that  he  had  to  and  that  his  conversations  with  the  President  were  not  protected  by \\nattorney-client privilege.823  The President then asked, “What about these notes?  Why do you take \\nnotes?  Lawyers don’t take notes.  I never had a lawyer who took notes.”824  McGahn responded \\nthat he keeps notes because he is a “real lawyer” and explained that notes create a record and are \\nnot a bad thing.825  The President said, “I’ve had a lot of great lawyers, like Roy Cohn.

The President’s repeated efforts to get McGahn to create a record \\n \\ndenying that the President had directed him to remove the Special Counsel would qualify as an \\nobstructive act if it had the natural tendency to constrain McGahn from testifying truthfully or to \\nundermine his credibility as a potential witness if he testified consistently with his memory, rather \\nthan with what the record said.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThere is some evidence that at the time the New York Times and Washington Post stories \\n \\nwere published in late January 2018, the President believed the stories were wrong and that he had \\nnever  told  McGahn  to  have  Rosenstein  remove  the  Special  Counsel.  The  President  correctly \\nunderstood that McGahn had not told the President directly that he planned to resign.  In addition, \\nthe President told Priebus and Porter that he had not sought to terminate the Special Counsel, and \\nin the Oval Office meeting with McGahn, the President said, “I never said to fire Mueller.  I never \\nsaid  ‘fire.’”  That  evidence  could  indicate  that  the  President  was  not  attempting  to  persuade \\nMcGahn to change his story but was instead offering his own—but different—recollection of the \\nsubstance of his June 2017 conversations with McGahn and McGahn’s reaction to them. \\n \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nOther evidence cuts against that understanding of the President’s conduct.  As previously \\n \\ndescribed, see Volume II, Section II.E, supra, substantial evidence supports McGahn’s account \\n \\nthat the President had directed him to have the Special Counsel removed, including the timing and \\ncontext of the President’s directive; the manner in which McGahn reacted; and the fact that the \\nPresident had been told the conflicts were insubstantial, were being considered by the Department \\nof  Justice,  and  should  be  raised  with  the  President’s  personal  counsel  rather  than  brought  to \\nMcGahn.  In addition, the President’s subsequent denials that he had told McGahn to have the \\n \\nSpecial Counsel removed were carefully worded.  When first asked about the New York Times \\n \\nstory, the President said, “Fake news, folks.  Fake news.  A typical New York Times fake story.”  \\nAnd when the President spoke with McGahn in the Oval Office, he focused on whether he had \\nused the word “fire,” saying, “I never said to fire Mueller.  I never said ‘fire’” and “Did I say the \\n \\nword ‘fire’?”  The President’s assertion in the Oval Office meeting that he had never directed \\nMcGahn to have the Special Counsel removed thus runs counter to the evidence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIn addition, even if the President sincerely disagreed with McGahn’s memory of the June \\n \\n17, 2017 events, the evidence indicates that the President knew by the time of the Oval Office \\n                                            \\n\\n828  McGahn 3/8/18 302, at 5.  Kelly did not recall discussing the Oval Office meeting with the \\n \\nPresident after the fact.  Kelly 8/2/18 302, at 2.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nmeeting that McGahn’s account differed and that McGahn was firm in his views.  Shortly after the \\nstory broke, the President’s counsel told McGahn’s counsel that the President wanted McGahn to \\nmake a statement denying he had been asked to fire the Special Counsel, but McGahn responded \\nthrough his counsel that that aspect of the story was accurate and he therefore could not comply \\n \\nwith the President’s request.  The President then directed Sanders to tell McGahn to correct the \\n \\nstory, but McGahn told her he would not do so because the story was accurate in reporting on the \\n \\nPresident’s order.  Consistent with that position, McGahn never issued a correction.  More than a \\nweek later, the President brought up the issue again with Porter, made comments indicating the \\n \\nPresident thought McGahn had leaked the story, and directed Porter to have McGahn create a \\n \\nrecord denying that the President had tried to fire the Special Counsel.  At that point, the President \\nsaid he might “have to get rid of” McGahn if McGahn did not comply.  McGahn again refused and \\ntold Porter, as he had told Sanders and as his counsel had told the President’s counsel, that the \\nPresident had in fact ordered him to have Rosenstein remove the Special Counsel.  That evidence \\nindicates that by the time of the Oval Office meeting the President was aware that McGahn did not \\n \\nthink the story was false and did not want to issue a statement or create a written record denying \\nfacts that McGahn believed to be true.  The President nevertheless persisted and asked McGahn to \\nrepudiate facts that McGahn had repeatedly said were accurate. \\n  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nb. \\n\\nNexus to an official proceeding.  By January 2018, the Special Counsel’s use of a \\n \\ngrand jury had been further confirmed by the return of several indictments.  The President also \\nwas aware that the Special Counsel was investigating obstruction-related events because, among \\nother  reasons,  on  January  8,  2018,  the  Special  Counsel’s  Office  provided  his  counsel  with  a \\n \\ndetailed  list  of  topics  for  a  possible  interview with  the  President.830  The  President  knew  that \\nMcGahn had personal knowledge of many of the events the Special Counsel was investigating and \\nthat McGahn had already been interviewed by Special Counsel investigators.  And in the Oval \\nOffice  meeting,  the  President  indicated  he  knew  that  McGahn  had  told  the  Special  Counsel’s \\nOffice  about  the  President’s  effort  to  remove  the  Special  Counsel.  The  President  challenged \\n \\nMcGahn  for  disclosing  that  information  and  for  taking  notes  that  he  viewed  as  creating \\nunnecessary legal exposure.  That evidence indicates the President’s awareness that the June 17, \\n \\n2017 events were relevant to the Special Counsel’s investigation and any grand jury investigation \\nthat might grow out of it.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nTo establish a nexus, it would be necessary to show that the President’s actions would have \\nthe natural tendency to affect such a proceeding or that they would hinder, delay, or prevent the \\n \\ncommunication of information to investigators.  Because McGahn had spoken to Special Counsel \\ninvestigators before January 2018, the President could not have been seeking to influence his prior \\nstatements in those interviews.  But because McGahn had repeatedly spoken to investigators and \\nthe obstruction inquiry was not complete, it was foreseeable that he would be interviewed again \\n \\non obstruction-related topics.  If the President were focused solely on a press strategy in seeking \\nto  have  McGahn  refute  the  New  York  Times  article,  a  nexus  to  a  proceeding  or  to  further \\ninvestigative interviews would not be shown.  But the President’s efforts to have McGahn write a \\nletter “for our records” approximately ten days after the stories had come out—well past the typical \\n                                            \\n\\n830  1/29/18  Letter,  President’s  Personal  Counsel  to  Special  Counsel’s  Office,  at  1-2  (“In  our \\n \\n \\nconversation of January 8, your office identified the following topics as areas you desired to address with \\nthe President in order to complete your investigation on the subjects of alleged collusion and obstruction of \\n \\njustice”; listing 16 topics). \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n119 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\ntime to issue a correction for a news story—indicates the President was not focused solely on a \\npress  strategy,  but  instead  likely  contemplated  the  ongoing  investigation  and  any  proceedings \\narising from it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nc. \\n\\nIntent.  Substantial evidence indicates that in repeatedly urging McGahn to dispute \\n \\nthat he was ordered to have the Special Counsel terminated, the President acted for the purpose of \\ninfluencing McGahn’s account in order to deflect or prevent further scrutiny of the President’s \\nconduct towards the investigation.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSeveral  facts  support  that  conclusion.  The  President  made  repeated  attempts  to  get \\n \\nMcGahn to change his story.  As described above, by the time of the last attempt, the evidence \\n \\nsuggests that the President had been told on multiple occasions that McGahn believed the President \\nhad ordered him to have the Special Counsel terminated.  McGahn interpreted his encounter with \\nthe President in the Oval Office as an attempt to test his mettle and see how committed he was to \\nhis memory of what had occurred.  The President had already laid the groundwork for pressing \\nMcGahn to alter his account by telling Porter that it might be necessary to fire McGahn if he did \\nnot deny the story, and Porter relayed that statement to McGahn.  Additional evidence of the \\nPresident’s intent may be gleaned from the fact that his counsel was sufficiently alarmed by the \\nprospect of the President’s meeting with McGahn that he called McGahn’s counsel and said that \\nMcGahn could not resign no matter what happened in the Oval Office that day.  The President’s \\n \\ncounsel was well aware of McGahn’s resolve not to issue what he believed to be a false account \\n \\nof events despite the President’s request.  Finally, as noted above, the President brought up the \\nSpecial Counsel investigation in his Oval Office meeting with McGahn and criticized him for \\ntelling  this  Office  about  the  June  17,  2017  events.  The  President’s  statements  reflect  his \\n \\nunderstanding—and his displeasure—that those events would be part of an obstruction-of-justice \\ninquiry. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nJ. \\n\\nThe President’s Conduct Towards Flynn, Manafort, \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nOverview \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\nIn addition to the interactions with McGahn described above, the President has taken other \\nactions  directed  at  possible  witnesses  in  the  Special  Counsel’s  investigation,  including  Flynn, \\nManafort, \\nand as described in the next section, Cohen.  When Flynn withdrew from a joint \\ndefense agreement with the President, the President’s personal counsel stated that Flynn’s actions \\nwould be viewed as reflecting “hostility” towards the President.  During Manafort’s prosecution \\n \\nand while the jury was deliberating, the President repeatedly stated that Manafort was being treated \\n \\nunfairly and made it known that Manafort could receive a pardon. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n. \\n\\n \\n\\nEvidence \\n\\n1.  Conduct Directed at Michael Flynn \\n\\n \\n\\nAs previously noted, see Volume II, Section II.B, supra, the President asked for Flynn’s \\n \\nresignation on February 13, 2017.  Following Flynn’s resignation, the President made positive \\npublic comments about Flynn, describing him as a “wonderful man,” “a fine person,” and a “very \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n120 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)HOMHOMHarm to Ongoing Matter\\x0c \\n\\ngood person.”831 The President also privately asked advisors to pass messages to Flynn conveying \\nthat the President still cared about him and encouraging him to stay strong.832 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn late November 2017, Flynn began to cooperate with this Office.  On November 22, 2017, \\nFlynn withdrew from a joint defense agreement he had with the President.833  Flynn’s counsel told \\nthe President’s personal counsel and counsel for the White House that Flynn could no longer have \\n   \\nconfidential  communications  with  the  White  House  or  the  President.834  Later  that  night,  the \\nPresident’s personal counsel left a voicemail for Flynn’s counsel that said: \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nI understand your situation, but let me see if I can’t state it in starker terms.  . . .

The President’s actions towards witnesses in the Special Counsel’s \\n \\ninvestigation would qualify as obstructive if they had the natural tendency to prevent particular \\nwitnesses from testifying truthfully, or otherwise would have the probable effect of influencing, \\ndelaying, or preventing their testimony to law enforcement.    \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nWith regard to Flynn, the President sent private and public messages to Flynn encouraging \\n \\nhim  to  stay  strong  and  conveying  that  the  President  still  cared  about  him  before  he  began  to \\ncooperate  with  the  government.  When  Flynn’s  attorneys  withdrew  him  from  a  joint  defense \\nagreement  with  the  President,  signaling  that  Flynn  was  potentially  cooperating  with  the \\ngovernment, the President’s personal counsel initially reminded Flynn’s counsel of the President’s \\nwarm feelings towards Flynn and said “that still remains.”  But when Flynn’s counsel reiterated \\nthat Flynn could no longer share information under a joint defense agreement, the President’s \\npersonal  counsel  stated  that  the  decision  would  be  interpreted  as  reflecting  Flynn’s  hostility \\ntowards the President.  That sequence of events could have had the potential to affect Flynn’s \\n \\ndecision  to  cooperate,  as  well  as  the  extent  of  that  cooperation.  Because  of  privilege  issues, \\n \\nhowever, we could not determine whether the President was personally involved in or knew about \\nthe specific message his counsel delivered to Flynn’s counsel. \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nWith respect to Manafort, there is evidence that the President’s actions had the potential to \\n \\n \\ninfluence Manafort’s decision whether to cooperate with the government.  The President and his \\npersonal counsel made repeated statements suggesting that a pardon was a possibility for Manafort, \\nwhile also making it clear that the President did not want Manafort to “flip” and cooperate with \\nthe government.  On June 15, 2018, the day the judge presiding over Manafort’s D.C. case was \\nconsidering whether to revoke his bail, the President said that he “felt badly” for Manafort and \\nstated, “I think a lot of it is very unfair.”  And when asked about a pardon for Manafort, the \\nPresident said, “I do want to see people treated fairly.  That’s what it’s all about.”  Later that day, \\nafter  Manafort’s  bail  was  revoked,  the  President  called  it  a  “tough  sentence”  that  was  “Very \\nunfair!”  Two days later, the President’s personal counsel stated that individuals involved in the \\nSpecial Counsel’s investigation could receive a pardon “if in fact the [P]resident and his advisors \\n. . . come to the conclusion that you have been treated unfairly”—using language that paralleled \\nhow the President had already described the treatment of Manafort.  Those statements, combined \\nwith the President’s commendation of Manafort for being a “brave man” who “refused to ‘break’,” \\nsuggested that a pardon was a more likely possibility if Manafort continued not to cooperate with \\nthe  government.  And  while  Manafort  eventually  pleaded  guilty  pursuant  to  a  cooperation \\nagreement, he was found to have violated the agreement by lying to investigators.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  President’s  public  statements  during  the  Manafort  trial,  including  during  jury \\n \\ndeliberations, also had the potential to influence the trial jury.  On the second day of trial, for \\nexample, the President called the prosecution a “terrible situation” and a “hoax” that “continues to \\nstain our country” and referred to Manafort as a “Reagan/Dole darling” who was “serving solitary \\nconfinement” even though he was “convicted of nothing.”  Those statements were widely picked \\nup by the press.  While jurors were instructed not to watch or read news stories about the case and \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n131 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)HOM\\x0c \\n\\n \\nare presumed to follow those instructions, the President’s statements during the trial generated \\nsubstantial media coverage that could have reached jurors if they happened to see the statements \\nor learned about them from others.  And the President’s statements during jury deliberations that \\nManafort “happens to be a very good person” and that “it’s very sad what they’ve done to Paul \\nManafort” had the potential to influence jurors who learned of the statements, which the President \\nmade just as jurors were considering whether to convict or acquit Manafort.   \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nb. \\n\\nNexus to an official proceeding.  The President’s actions towards Flynn, Manafort, \\n \\n appear to have been connected to pending or anticipated official proceedings involving \\n \\neach individual.  The President’s conduct towards Flynn \\nprincipally occurred when both \\nwere under criminal investigation by the Special Counsel’s Office and press reports speculated \\nabout whether they would cooperate with the Special Counsel’s investigation.  And the President’s \\n \\nconduct towards Manafort was directly connected to the official proceedings involving him.  The \\n \\nPresident made statements about Manafort and the charges against him during Manafort’s criminal \\ntrial.  And the President’s comments about the prospect of Manafort “flipping” occurred when it \\nwas clear the Special Counsel continued to oversee grand jury proceedings. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nc. \\n\\n \\nIntent.  Evidence concerning the President’s intent related to Flynn as a potential \\nwitness is inconclusive.  As previously noted, because of privilege issues we do not have evidence \\nestablishing whether the President knew about or was involved in his counsel’s communications \\n \\nwith Flynn’s counsel stating that Flynn’s decision to withdraw from the joint defense agreement \\n \\nand  cooperate  with  the  government  would  be  viewed  as  reflecting  “hostility”  towards  the \\nPresident.  And regardless of what the President’s personal counsel communicated, the President \\ncontinued  to  express  sympathy  for  Flynn  after  he  pleaded  guilty  pursuant  to  a  cooperation \\nagreement, stating that Flynn had “led a very strong life” and the President “fe[lt] very badly” \\n \\nabout what had happened to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nEvidence concerning the President’s conduct towards Manafort indicates that the President \\n \\nintended  to encourage Manafort to  not  cooperate  with  the  government.  Before Manafort  was \\n \\nconvicted, the President repeatedly stated that Manafort had been treated unfairly.  One day after \\nManafort was convicted on eight felony charges and potentially faced a lengthy prison term, the \\nPresident said that Manafort was “a brave man” for refusing to “break” and that “flipping” “almost \\nought to be outlawed.”  At the same time, although the President had privately told aides he did \\nnot like Manafort, he publicly called Manafort “a good man” and said he had a “wonderful family.”  \\nAnd  when  the  President  was  asked  whether  he  was  considering  a  pardon  for  Manafort,  the \\nPresident did not respond directly and instead said he had “great respect for what [Manafort]’s \\ndone, in terms of what he’s gone through.”  The President added that “some of the charges they \\nthrew against him, every consultant, every lobbyist in Washington probably does.”  In light of the \\nPresident’s counsel’s previous statements that the investigations “might get cleaned up with some \\npresidential  pardons”  and  that  a  pardon  would  be  possible  if  the  President  “come[s]  to  the \\nconclusion  that  you  have  been  treated  unfairly,”  the  evidence  supports  the  inference  that  the \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n132 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)Harm to Ongoing MatterHOMHOM\\x0c \\n\\nPresident  intended  Manafort  to  believe  that  he  could  receive  a  pardon,  which  would  make \\ncooperation with the government as a means of obtaining a lesser sentence unnecessary.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nWe also examined the evidence of the President’s intent in making public statements about \\n \\nManafort at the beginning of his trial and when the jury was deliberating.  Some evidence supports \\na conclusion that the President intended, at least in part, to influence the jury.  The trial generated \\nwidespread publicity, and as the jury began to deliberate, commentators suggested that an acquittal \\nwould add to pressure to end the Special Counsel’s investigation. By publicly stating on the second \\nday of deliberations that Manafort “happens to be a very good person” and that “it’s very sad what \\nthey’ve done to Paul Manafort” right after calling the Special Counsel’s investigation a “rigged \\nwitch hunt,” the President’s statements could, if they reached jurors, have the natural tendency to \\nengender sympathy for Manafort among jurors, and a factfinder could infer that the President \\nintended that result.  But there are alternative explanations for the President’s comments, including \\nthat  he  genuinely  felt sorry  for  Manafort  or  that  his  goal was not to  influence  the  jury  but to \\ninfluence public opinion.  The President’s comments also could have been intended to continue \\nsending a message to Manafort that a pardon was possible.  As described above, the President \\nmade his comments about Manafort being “a very good person” immediately after declining to \\n \\nanswer a question about whether he would pardon Manafort.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n133 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

During the campaign, Cohen pursued the Trump Tower Moscow project on behalf \\nof  the  Trump  Organization.  Cohen  briefed  candidate  Trump  on  the  project  numerous  times, \\nincluding discussing whether Trump should travel to Russia to advance the deal.  After the media \\nbegan questioning Trump’s connections to Russia, Cohen promoted a “party line” that publicly \\ndistanced Trump from Russia and asserted he had no business there.  Cohen continued to adhere \\nto that party line in 2017, when Congress asked him to provide documents and testimony in its \\nRussia investigation.  In an attempt to minimize the President’s connections to Russia, Cohen \\nsubmitted a letter to Congress falsely stating that he only briefed Trump on the Trump Tower \\nMoscow project three times, that he did not consider asking Trump to travel to Russia, that Cohen \\nhad not received a response to an outreach he made to the Russian government, and that the project \\nended in January 2016, before the first Republican caucus or primary.  While working on the \\ncongressional statement, Cohen had extensive discussions with the President’s personal counsel, \\nwho, according to Cohen, said that Cohen should not contradict the President and should keep the \\n \\nstatement short and “tight.”  After the FBI searched Cohen’s home and office in April 2018, the \\nPresident publicly asserted that Cohen would not “flip” and privately passed messages of support \\nto him.  Cohen also discussed pardons with the President’s personal counsel and believed that if \\nhe stayed on message, he would get a pardon or the President would do “something else” to make \\nthe investigation end.  But after Cohen began cooperating with the government in July 2018, the \\nPresident  publicly  criticized  him,  called  him  a  “rat,”  and  suggested  his  family  members  had \\ncommitted crimes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nEvidence \\n\\n1.

Trump.909  The  Trump  Organization  had  previously  and \\n                                            \\n\\n909  In August 2018 and November 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to multiple crimes of deception, \\nincluding making false statements to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project, as described later \\nin this section.  When Cohen first met with investigators from this Office, he repeated the same lies he told \\nCongress about the Trump Tower Moscow project.  Cohen 8/7/18 302, at 12-17.  But after Cohen pleaded \\n \\nguilty to offenses in the Southern District of New York on August 21, 2018, he met with investigators again \\n \\nand corrected the record.  The Office found Cohen’s testimony in these subsequent proffer sessions to be \\nconsistent with and corroborated by other information obtained in the course of the Office’s investigation.  \\nThe Office’s sentencing submission in Cohen’s criminal case stated: “Starting with his second meeting with \\n \\n \\nthe [Special Counsel’s Office] in September 2018, the defendant has accepted responsibility not only for \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n134 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

Cohen Submits False Statements to Congress Minimizing the Trump Tower \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMoscow Project in Accordance with the Party Line \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\nIn  early  May  2017,  Cohen  received  requests  from  Congress  to  provide  testimony  and \\ndocuments in connection with congressional investigations of Russian interference in the 2016 \\nelection.953  At  that  time,  Cohen  understood  Congress’s  interest  in  him  to  be  focused  on  the \\nallegations in the Steele reporting concerning a meeting Cohen allegedly had with Russian officials \\nin Prague during the campaign.954  Cohen had never traveled to Prague and was not concerned \\nabout those allegations, which he believed were provably false.955  On May 18, 2017, Cohen met \\nwith the President to discuss the request from Congress, and the President instructed Cohen that \\n   \\nhe should cooperate because there was nothing there.956 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nCohen eventually entered into a joint defense agreement (JDA) with the President and other \\n   \\n \\nindividuals  who  were  part  of  the  Russia  investigation.957 \\nIn  the  months  leading  up  to  his \\n \\ncongressional testimony, Cohen frequently spoke with the President’s personal counsel.958  Cohen \\n                                            \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n950 Cohen 9/18/18 302, at 5-6. \\n951 Cohen 9/18/18 302, at 6. \\n \\n952 Cohen 9/12/18 302, at 10. \\n \\n953  P-SCO-000000328 (5/9/17 Letter, HPSCI to Cohen); P-SCO-000000331 (5/12/17 Letter, SSCI \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n \\nto Cohen). \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n954 Cohen 11/20/18 302, at 2-3. \\n \\n955 Cohen 11/20/18 302, at 2-3. \\n \\n956 Cohen 11/12/18 302, at 2; Cohen 11/20/19 302, at 3.  \\n \\n \\n957 Cohen 11/12/18 302, at 2. \\n \\n \\n \\n958  Cohen  11/12/18  302,  at  2-3;  Cohen  11/20/18,  at  2-6.  Cohen  told  investigators  about  his \\nconversations with the President’s personal counsel after waiving any privilege of his own and after this \\nOffice advised his counsel not to provide any communications that would be covered by any other privilege, \\n \\nincluding communications protected by a joint defense or common interest privilege.  As a result, most of \\nwhat Cohen told us about his conversations with the President’s personal counsel concerned what Cohen \\nhad communicated to the President’s personal counsel, and not what was said in response.  Cohen described \\n  \\ncertain statements made by the President’s personal counsel, however, that are set forth in this section. \\nCohen and his counsel were better positioned than this Office to evaluate whether any privilege protected \\n \\nthose statements because they had knowledge of the scope of their joint defense agreement and access to \\n \\nprivileged communications that may have provided context for evaluating the statements they shared.

By \\nthe end of January 2016, I determined that the proposal was not feasible for a variety of business \\nreasons and should not be pursued further.  Based on my  business determinations, the Trump \\nOrganization  abandoned  the  proposal.”967  Second,  although  Cohen  and  candidate  Trump  had \\ndiscussed possible travel to Russia by Trump to pursue the venture, the statement said, “Despite \\novertures by Mr. Sater, I never considered asking Mr. Trump to travel to Russia in connection with \\nthis proposal.  I told Mr. Sater that Mr. Trump would not travel to Russia unless there was a \\ndefinitive agreement in place.”968 Third, although Cohen had regularly briefed Trump on the status \\n\\n   \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                            \\nTrump Tower Moscow.  The President’s personal counsel declined and, through his own counsel, indicated \\n \\nthat he could not disaggregate information he had obtained from Cohen from information he had obtained \\n \\nfrom other parties in the JDA.  In view of the admonition this Office gave to Cohen’s counsel to withhold \\ncommunications that could be covered by privilege, the President’s personal counsel’s uncertainty about \\nthe provenance of his own knowledge, the burden on a privilege holder to establish the elements to support \\n \\na claim of privilege, and the substance of the statements themselves, we have included relevant statements \\n \\nCohen provided in this report.

Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client—totally unheard \\n \\nof & perhaps illegal.  The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong!”1041  On \\nJuly 27, 2018, after the media reported that Cohen was willing to inform investigators that Donald \\n \\nTrump Jr. told his father about the June 9, 2016 meeting to get “dirt” on Hillary Clinton,1042 the \\nPresident tweeted:  “[S]o the Fake News doesn’t waste my time with dumb questions, NO, I did \\nNOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr.

And by being weak, unlike other people \\nthat you watch—he is a weak person.  And what he’s trying to do is get a reduced sentence.  So \\nhe’s lying about a project that everybody knew about.”1054   The President also brought up Cohen’s \\nwritten submission to Congress regarding the Trump Tower Moscow project: “So here’s the story: \\nGo back and look at the paper that Michael Cohen wrote before he testified in the House and/or \\n \\nSenate.  It talked about his position.”1055  The President added, “Even if [Cohen] was right, it \\ndoesn’t matter because I was allowed to do whatever I wanted during the campaign.”1056 \\n\\n    \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nIn light of the President’s public statements following Cohen’s guilty plea that he “decided \\nnot to do the project,” this Office again sought information from the President about whether he \\nparticipated in any discussions about the project being abandoned or no longer pursued, including \\nwhen he “decided not to do the project,” who he spoke to about that decision, and what motivated \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                            \\n\\n(a) through (g)). \\n\\n1050 Written Responses of Donald J.

We gathered evidence of the President’s conduct related to Cohen \\n \\non two issues: (i) whether the President or others aided or participated in Cohen’s false statements \\n \\nto Congress, and (ii) whether the President took actions that would have the natural tendency to \\nprevent Cohen from providing truthful information to the government. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\ni. \\n\\nFirst, with regard to Cohen’s false statements to Congress, while there is \\n \\n \\nevidence, described below, that the President knew Cohen provided false testimony to Congress \\nabout the Trump Tower Moscow project, the evidence available to us does not establish that the \\nPresident directed or aided Cohen’s false testimony.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nCohen said that his statements to Congress followed a “party line” that developed within \\nthe campaign to align with the President’s public statements distancing the President from Russia.  \\nCohen also recalled that, in speaking with the President in advance of testifying, he made it clear \\nthat he would stay on message—which Cohen believed they both understood would require false \\ntestimony.  But Cohen said that he and the President did not explicitly discuss whether Cohen’s \\ntestimony about the Trump Tower Moscow project would be or was false, and the President did \\n \\nnot direct him to provide false testimony.  Cohen also said he did not tell the President about the \\nspecifics of his planned testimony.  During the time when his statement to Congress was being \\ndrafted and circulated to members of the JDA, Cohen did not speak directly to the President about \\nthe statement, but rather communicated with the President’s personal counsel—as corroborated by \\nphone records showing extensive communications between Cohen and the President’s personal \\ncounsel before Cohen submitted his statement and when he testified before Congress.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nCohen recalled that in his discussions with the President’s personal counsel on August 27, \\n2017—the day before Cohen’s statement was submitted to Congress—Cohen said that there were \\n \\nmore  communications  with  Russia  and  more  communications  with  candidate  Trump  than  the \\nstatement reflected.  Cohen recalled expressing some concern at that time.  According to Cohen, \\nthe  President’s  personal  counsel—who  did  not  have  first-hand  knowledge  of  the  project— \\nresponded by saying that there was no need to muddy the water, that it was unnecessary to include \\nthose details because the project did not take place, and that Cohen should keep his statement short \\nand tight, not elaborate, stay on message, and not contradict the President.  Cohen’s recollection \\nof the content of those conversations is consistent with direction about the substance of Cohen’s \\n \\ndraft statement that appeared to come from members of the JDA.  For example, Cohen omitted \\n \\nany reference to his outreach to Russian government officials to set up a meeting between Trump \\nand Putin during the United Nations General Assembly, and Cohen believed it was a decision of \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                            \\nof  conversations  beyond  that  contained  in  the  President’s  [written  responses  to  the  Special  Counsel’s \\n \\nOffice].”  2/6/19 Letter, President’s Personal Counsel to Special Counsel’s Office. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n153 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

The President’s \\nconversations with his personal counsel were presumptively protected by attorney-client privilege, \\n \\nand we did not seek to obtain the contents of any such communications.  The absence of evidence \\nabout  the  President  and  his  counsel’s  conversations  about  the  drafting  of  Cohen’s  statement \\n \\nprecludes us from assessing what, if any, role the President played.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nii. \\n\\nSecond, we considered whether the President took actions that would have \\nthe  natural  tendency  to  prevent  Cohen  from  providing  truthful  information  to  criminal \\ninvestigators or to Congress. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nBefore Cohen began to cooperate with the government, the President publicly and privately \\n \\nurged Cohen to stay on message and not “flip.”  Cohen recalled the President’s personal counsel \\ntelling him that he would be protected so long as he did not go “rogue.”  In the days and weeks \\nthat followed the April 2018 searches of Cohen’s home and office, the President told reporters that \\nCohen was a “good man” and said he was “a fine person with a wonderful family . . . who I have \\nalways  liked  &  respected.”  Privately,  the  President  told  Cohen  to  “hang  in  there”  and  “stay \\nstrong.”  People who were close to both Cohen and the President passed messages to Cohen that \\n“the President loves you,” “the boss loves you,” and “everyone knows the boss has your back.”  \\nThrough the President’s personal counsel, the President also had previously told Cohen “thanks \\nfor what you do” after Cohen provided information to the media about payments to women that, \\naccording  to  Cohen,  both  Cohen  and  the  President  knew  was  false.    At  that  time,  the  Trump \\n \\nOrganization continued to pay Cohen’s legal fees, which was important to Cohen.  Cohen also \\nrecalled discussing the possibility of a pardon with the President’s personal counsel, who told him \\nto stay on message and everything would be fine.  The President indicated in his public statements \\nthat a pardon had not been ruled out, and also stated publicly that “[m]ost people will flip if the \\n \\nGovernment lets them out of trouble” but that he “d[idn’t] see Michael doing that.”   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAfter it was reported that Cohen intended to cooperate with the government, however, the \\nPresident accused Cohen of “mak[ing] up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam \\n(Taxi cabs maybe?),” called Cohen a “rat,” and on multiple occasions publicly suggested that \\nCohen’s family members had committed crimes.  The evidence concerning this sequence of events \\ncould support an inference that the President used inducements in the form of positive messages \\n \\nin an effort to get Cohen not to cooperate, and then turned to attacks and intimidation to deter the \\n \\nprovision of information or undermine Cohen’s credibility once Cohen began cooperating. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nb. \\n\\nNexus to an official proceeding.  The President’s relevant conduct towards Cohen \\n \\noccurred when the President knew the Special Counsel’s Office, Congress, and the U.S. Attorney’s \\nOffice for the Southern District of New York were investigating Cohen’s conduct.  The President \\nacknowledged through his public statements and tweets that Cohen potentially could cooperate \\nwith the government investigations.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n154 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\nc. \\n\\n \\n \\nIntent.  In  analyzing  the  President’s  intent  in  his  actions  towards  Cohen  as  a \\npotential witness, there is evidence that could support the inference that the President intended to \\ndiscourage Cohen from cooperating with the government because Cohen’s information would shed \\nadverse light on the President’s campaign-period conduct and statements. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\ni.    \\n\\nCohen’s  false  congressional  testimony  about  the  Trump  Tower  Moscow \\n   \\n \\nproject was designed to minimize connections between the President and Russia and to help limit \\nthe congressional and DOJ Russia investigations—a goal that was in the President’s interest, as \\n \\nreflected by the President’s own statements.  During and after the campaign, the President made \\n \\nrepeated statements that he had “no business” in Russia and said that there were “no deals that \\ncould  happen  in  Russia,  because  we’ve  stayed  away.”  As  Cohen  knew,  and  as  he  recalled \\ncommunicating  to  the  President  during  the  campaign,  Cohen’s  pursuit  of  the  Trump  Tower \\nMoscow project cast doubt on the accuracy or completeness of these statements.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nIn connection with his guilty plea, Cohen admitted that he had multiple conversations with \\n \\ncandidate Trump to give him status updates about the Trump Tower Moscow project, that the \\nconversations continued through at least June 2016, and that he discussed with Trump possible \\ntravel to Russia to pursue the project.  The conversations were not off-hand, according to Cohen, \\nbecause the project had the potential to be so lucrative.  In addition, text messages to and from \\nCohen and other records further establish that Cohen’s efforts to advance the project did not end \\nin January 2016 and that in May and June 2016, Cohen was considering the timing for possible \\ntrips to Russia by him and Trump in connection with the project. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe evidence could support an inference that the President was aware of these facts at the \\ntime of Cohen’s false statements to Congress.  Cohen discussed the project with the President in \\nearly 2017 following media inquiries.  Cohen recalled that on September 20, 2017, the day after \\nhe released to the public his opening remarks to Congress—which said the project “was terminated \\n \\nin January of 2016”—the President’s personal counsel told him the President was pleased with \\n \\nwhat Cohen had said about Trump Tower Moscow.  And after Cohen’s guilty plea, the President \\n \\ntold reporters that he had ultimately decided not to do the project, which supports the inference \\n \\nthat he remained aware of his own involvement in the project and the period during the Campaign \\nin which the project was being pursued.     \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\nii. \\n\\nThe President’s public remarks following Cohen’s guilty plea also suggest \\n \\nthat the President may have been concerned about what Cohen told investigators about the Trump \\nTower Moscow project.  At the time the President submitted written answers to questions from \\nthis Office about the project and other subjects, the media had reported that Cohen was cooperating \\nwith the government but Cohen had not yet pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress.  \\nAccordingly, it was not publicly known what information about the project Cohen had provided \\nto the government.  In his written answers, the President did not provide details about the timing \\nand substance of his discussions with Cohen about the project and gave no indication that he had \\ndecided to no longer pursue the project.  Yet after Cohen pleaded guilty, the President publicly \\n \\nstated that he had personally made the decision to abandon the project.  The President then declined \\n \\nto clarify the seeming discrepancy to our Office or answer additional questions.  The content and \\ntiming of the President’s provision of information about his knowledge and actions regarding the \\nTrump Tower Moscow project is evidence that the President may have been concerned about the \\ninformation that Cohen could provide as a witness.          \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n155 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\niii. \\n\\n \\nThe President’s concern about Cohen cooperating may have been directed \\nat the Southern District of New York investigation into other aspects of the President’s dealings \\n \\nwith Cohen rather than an investigation of Trump Tower Moscow.  There also is some evidence \\n \\nthat the President’s concern about Cohen cooperating was based on the President’s stated belief \\n \\nthat Cohen would provide false testimony against the President in an attempt to obtain a lesser \\nsentence for his unrelated criminal conduct.  The President tweeted that Manafort, unlike Cohen, \\nrefused to “break” and “make up stories in order to get a ‘deal.’”  And after Cohen pleaded guilty \\n \\n \\nto making false statements to Congress, the President said, “what [Cohen]’s trying to do is get a \\nreduced sentence.  So he’s lying about a project that everybody knew about.”  But the President \\nalso appeared to defend the underlying conduct, saying, “Even if [Cohen] was right, it doesn’t \\nmatter because I was allowed to do whatever I wanted during the campaign.”  As described above, \\nthere is evidence that the President knew that Cohen had made false statements about the Trump \\n \\nTower Moscow project and that Cohen did so to protect the President and minimize the President’s \\nconnections to Russia during the campaign. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\niv.   \\n\\nFinally,  the  President’s  statements  insinuating  that  members  of  Cohen’s \\nfamily committed crimes after Cohen began cooperating with the government could be viewed as \\nan effort to retaliate against Cohen and chill further testimony adverse to the President by Cohen \\nor others.  It is possible that the President believes, as reflected in his tweets, that Cohen “ma[d]e[] \\nup stories” in order to get a deal for himself and “get his wife and father-in-law . . . off Scott Free.”  \\nIt also is possible that the President’s mention of Cohen’s wife and father-in-law were not intended \\nto affect Cohen as a witness but rather were part of a public-relations strategy aimed at discrediting \\nCohen  and  deflecting  attention  away  from  the  President  on  Cohen-related  matters.  But  the \\nPresident’s suggestion that Cohen’s family members committed crimes happened more than once, \\nincluding just before Cohen was sentenced (at the same time as the President stated that Cohen \\n“should, in my opinion, serve a full and complete sentence”) and again just before Cohen was \\n \\nscheduled to testify before Congress.  The timing of the statements supports an inference that they \\nwere intended at least in part to discourage Cohen from further cooperation.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nL. \\n\\nOverarching Factual Issues \\n\\nAlthough  this  report  does  not  contain  a  traditional  prosecution  decision  or  declination \\ndecision,  the  evidence  supports  several  general  conclusions  relevant  to  analysis  of  the  facts \\nconcerning the President’s course of conduct.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1.  Three features of this case render it atypical compared to the heartland obstruction-of-\\n\\n \\n\\njustice prosecutions brought by the Department of Justice.   \\n\\nFirst, the conduct involved actions by the President.  Some of the conduct did not implicate \\nthe  President’s  constitutional  authority  and  raises  garden-variety  obstruction-of-justice  issues. \\nOther  events  we  investigated,  however,  drew  upon  the  President’s  Article  II  authority,  which \\n \\nraised constitutional issues that we address in Volume II, Section III.B, infra.   A factual analysis \\n \\nof that conduct would have to take into account both that the President’s acts were facially lawful \\nand that his position as head of the Executive Branch provides him with unique and powerful \\nmeans of influencing official proceedings, subordinate officers, and potential witnesses.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n156 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\nSecond, many obstruction cases involve the attempted or actual cover-up of an underlying \\ncrime.  Personal criminal conduct can furnish strong evidence that the individual had an improper \\nobstructive purpose, see, e.g., United States v. Willoughby, 860 F.2d 15, 24 (2d Cir. 1988), or that \\nhe contemplated an effect on an official proceeding, see, e.g., United States v. Binday, 804 F.3d \\n558, 591 (2d Cir. 2015).  But proof of such a crime is not an element of an obstruction offense.  \\nSee United States v. Greer, 872 F.3d 790, 798 (6th Cir. 2017) (stating, in applying the obstruction \\n \\nsentencing  guideline,  that  “obstruction  of  a  criminal  investigation  is  punishable  even  if  the \\nprosecution is ultimately unsuccessful or even if the investigation ultimately reveals no underlying \\ncrime”).  Obstruction of justice can be motivated by a desire to protect non-criminal personal \\ninterests, to protect against investigations where underlying criminal liability falls into a gray area, \\n \\nor to avoid personal embarrassment.  The injury to the integrity of the justice system is the same \\n \\nregardless of whether a person committed an underlying wrong.  \\n  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIn this investigation, the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an \\nunderlying crime related to Russian election interference.  But the evidence does point to a range \\nof other possible personal motives animating the President’s conduct.  These include concerns that \\ncontinued  investigation  would  call  into  question  the  legitimacy  of  his  election  and  potential \\n \\nuncertainty  about  whether  certain  events—such  as  advance  notice  of  WikiLeaks’s  release  of \\nhacked information or the June 9, 2016 meeting between senior campaign officials and Russians— \\ncould be seen as criminal activity by the President, his campaign, or his family.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThird,  many  of  the  President’s  acts  directed  at  witnesses,  including  discouragement  of \\ncooperation with the government and suggestions of possible future pardons, occurred in public \\nview.  While it may be more difficult to establish that public-facing acts were motivated by a \\ncorrupt intent, the President’s power to influence actions, persons, and events is enhanced by his \\nunique ability to attract attention through use of mass communications.  And no principle of law \\nexcludes public acts from the scope of obstruction statutes.  If the likely effect of the acts is to \\n \\nintimidate witnesses or alter their testimony, the justice system’s integrity is equally threatened. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n2.  Although  the  events  we  investigated  involved  discrete  acts—e.g.,  the  President’s \\n \\nstatement to Comey about the Flynn investigation, his termination of Comey, and his efforts to \\nremove the Special Counsel—it is important to view the President’s pattern of conduct as a whole.  \\nThat pattern sheds light on the nature of the President’s acts and the inferences that can be drawn \\nabout his intent. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\na.  Our investigation found multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting \\nundue  influence  over  law  enforcement  investigations,  including  the  Russian-interference  and \\nobstruction investigations.  The incidents were often carried out through one-on-one meetings in \\nwhich the President sought to use his official power outside of usual channels.  These actions \\nranged  from  efforts  to  remove  the  Special  Counsel  and  to  reverse  the  effect  of  the  Attorney \\n \\nGeneral’s recusal; to the attempted use of official power to limit the scope of the investigation; to \\n \\ndirect and indirect contacts with witnesses with the potential to influence their testimony.  Viewing \\nthe  acts  collectively  can  help  to  illuminate  their  significance.  For  example,  the  President’s \\ndirection to McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed was followed almost immediately by \\n \\nhis  direction  to  Lewandowski  to  tell  the  Attorney  General  to  limit  the  scope  of  the  Russia \\n \\ninvestigation to prospective election-interference only—a temporal connection that suggests that \\nboth acts were taken with a related purpose with respect to the investigation.     \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n157 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe President’s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is \\nlargely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede \\nto his requests.  Comey did not end the investigation of Flynn, which ultimately resulted in Flynn’s \\nprosecution and conviction for lying to the FBI.  McGahn did not tell the Acting Attorney General \\n \\nthat the Special Counsel must be removed, but was instead prepared to resign over the President’s \\norder.  Lewandowski and Dearborn did not deliver the President’s message to Sessions that he \\n \\nshould confine the Russia investigation to future election meddling only.  And McGahn refused to \\nrecede from his recollections about events surrounding the President’s direction to have the Special \\nCounsel removed, despite the President’s multiple demands that he do so.  Consistent with that \\n \\npattern,  the  evidence  we  obtained  would  not  support  potential  obstruction  charges  against  the \\nPresident’s aides and associates beyond those already filed.   \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nb.  In considering the full scope of the conduct we investigated, the President’s actions can \\nbe divided into two distinct phases reflecting a possible shift in the President’s motives.  In the \\n \\nfirst phase, before the President fired Comey, the President had been assured that the FBI had not \\nopened an investigation of him personally.  The President deemed it critically important to make \\n \\npublic that he was not under investigation, and he included that information in his termination \\nletter to Comey after other efforts to have that information disclosed were unsuccessful.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSoon after he fired Comey, however, the President became aware that investigators were \\nconducting  an  obstruction-of-justice  inquiry  into  his  own  conduct.  That  awareness  marked  a \\n \\nsignificant  change  in  the  President’s  conduct  and  the  start  of  a  second  phase  of  action.  The \\nPresident launched public attacks on the investigation and individuals involved in it who could \\npossess evidence adverse to the President, while in private, the President engaged in a series of \\ntargeted efforts to control the investigation.  For instance, the President attempted to remove the \\nSpecial Counsel; he sought to have Attorney General Sessions unrecuse himself and limit the \\ninvestigation; he sought to prevent public disclosure of information about the June 9, 2016 meeting \\nbetween Russians and campaign officials; and he used public forums to attack potential witnesses \\n \\nwho might offer adverse information and to praise witnesses who declined to cooperate with the \\ngovernment.  Judgments about the nature of the President’s motives during each phase would be \\n \\ninformed by the totality of the evidence.     \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n158 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

LEGAL DEFENSES TO THE APPLICATION OF OBSTRUCTION-OF-JUSTICE STATUTES TO \\n\\n     \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT \\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\nThe  President’s  personal  counsel  has  written  to  this  Office  to  advance  statutory  and \\nconstitutional  defenses  to  the  potential  application  of  the  obstruction-of-justice  statutes  to  the \\nPresident’s  conduct.1072  As  a  statutory  matter,  the  President’s  counsel  has  argued  that  a  core \\n \\nobstruction-of-justice statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(2), does not cover the President’s actions.1073 \\n  \\nAs a constitutional matter, the President’s counsel argued that the President cannot obstruct justice \\n \\nby exercising his constitutional authority to close Department of Justice investigations or terminate \\nthe FBI Director.1074  Under that view, any statute that restricts the President’s exercise of those \\n \\npowers  would  impermissibly  intrude  on  the  President’s  constitutional  role.  The  President’s \\ncounsel has conceded that the President may be subject to criminal laws that do not directly involve \\nexercises  of  his  Article  II  authority,  such  as  laws  prohibiting  bribing  witnesses  or  suborning \\nperjury.1075  But counsel has made a categorical argument that “the President’s exercise of his \\nconstitutional  authority  here  to  terminate  an  FBI  Director  and  to  close  investigations  cannot \\n  \\nconstitutionally constitute obstruction of justice.”1076 \\n\\n \\n  \\n\\n   \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIn analyzing counsel’s statutory arguments, we concluded that the President’s proposed \\ninterpretation  of  Section  1512(c)(2)  is  contrary  to  the  litigating  position  of  the  Department  of \\nJustice and is not supported by principles of statutory construction.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nAs for the constitutional arguments, we recognized that the Department of Justice and the \\n \\ncourts  have  not  definitively  resolved  these  constitutional  issues.  We  therefore  analyzed  the \\nPresident’s position through the framework of Supreme Court precedent addressing the separation \\nof  powers.  Under  that  framework,  we  concluded,  Article  II  of  the  Constitution  does  not \\ncategorically and permanently immunize the President from potential liability for the conduct that \\n \\nwe investigated.  Rather, our analysis led us to conclude that the obstruction-of-justice statutes can \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                            \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1072  6/23/17  Letter, President’s Personal Counsel to Special Counsel’s Office;  see also  1/29/18 \\n \\nLetter,  President’s  Personal  Counsel  to  Special  Counsel’s  Office;  2/6/18  Letter,  President’s  Personal \\nCounsel to Special Counsel’s Office;  8/8/18 Letter, President’s Personal Counsel to Special Counsel’s \\n \\nOffice, at 4. \\n \\n\\n1073  2/6/18 Letter, President’s Personal Counsel to Special Counsel’s Office, at 2-9.

Section 1512(c) provides:   \\n\\n(c) Whoever corruptly— \\n \\n\\n(1) alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or other object, or \\n \\nattempts to do so, with the intent to impair the object’s integrity or availability for \\n \\nuse in an official proceeding; or \\n\\n \\n\\n(2) otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts \\nto do so, \\n\\nshall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n   \\n\\nThe  Department  of  Justice  has  taken  the  position  that  Section  1512(c)(2)  states  a  broad, \\n \\nindependent,  and  unqualified  prohibition  on  obstruction  of  justice.1077  While  defendants  have \\nargued that subsection (c)(2) should be read to cover only acts that would impair the availability \\n \\nor integrity of evidence because that is subsection (c)(1)’s focus, strong arguments weigh against \\nthat proposed limitation.  The text of Section 1512(c)(2) confirms that its sweep is not tethered to \\nSection 1512(c)(1); courts have so interpreted it; its history does not counsel otherwise; and no \\n \\nprinciple  of  statutory  construction  dictates  a  contrary  view.  On  its  face,  therefore,  Section \\n1512(c)(2) applies to all corrupt means of obstructing a proceeding, pending or contemplated— \\nincluding by improper exercises of official power.  In addition, other statutory provisions that are \\npotentially  applicable  to  certain  conduct  we  investigated  broadly  prohibit  obstruction  of \\nproceedings that are pending before courts, grand juries, and Congress.  See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1503, \\n1505.  Congress has also specifically prohibited witness tampering.  See 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b). \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1.  The Text of Section 1512(c)(2) Prohibits a Broad Range of Obstructive Acts \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSeveral textual features of Section 1512(c)(2) support the conclusion that the provision \\nbroadly  prohibits corrupt  means  of  obstructing  justice  and  is  not  limited  by  the  more  specific \\nprohibitions in Section 1512(c)(1), which focus on evidence impairment.   \\n\\n \\n\\nFirst,  the  text  of  Section  1512(c)(2)  is  unqualified: \\n\\nit  reaches  acts  that  “obstruct[], \\ninfluence[], or impede[] any official proceeding” when committed “corruptly.”  Nothing in Section \\n \\n1512(c)(2)’s  text  limits  the  provision  to  acts  that  would  impair  the  integrity  or  availability  of \\n \\nevidence for use in an official proceeding.  In contrast, Section 1512(c)(1) explicitly includes the \\n \\nrequirement that the defendant act “with the intent to impair the object’s integrity or availability \\n                                            \\n\\n1077  See U.S. Br., United States v.

See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1512(a)(2)(B)(ii) (use of physical force with intent to cause a \\n \\nperson to destroy an object “with intent to impair the integrity or availability of the object for use \\n \\nin  an  official  proceeding”);  1512(b)(2)(B)  (use  of  intimidation,  threats,  corrupt  persuasion,  or \\nmisleading conduct with intent to cause a person to destroy an object “with intent to impair the \\nintegrity or availability of the object for use in an official proceeding”).  But no comparable intent \\nor conduct element focused on evidence impairment appears in Section 1512(c)(2).  The intent \\nelement  in  Section  1512(c)(2)  comes  from  the  word  “corruptly.”  See,  e.g.,  United  States  v. \\nMcKibbins, 656 F.3d 707, 711 (7th Cir. 2011) (“The intent element is important because the word \\n‘corruptly’  is  what  serves  to  separate  criminal  and  innocent  acts  of  obstruction.”)  (internal \\nquotation  marks  omitted).  And  the  conduct  element  in  Section  1512(c)(2)  is  “obstruct[ing], \\ninfluenc[ing], or imped[ing]” a proceeding.  Congress is presumed to have acted intentionally in \\nthe disparate inclusion and exclusion of evidence-impairment language.  See Loughrin v. United \\nStates, 573 U.S. 351, 358 (2014) (“[W]hen ‘Congress includes particular language in one section \\nof a statute but omits it in another’—let alone in the very next provision—this Court ‘presume[s]’ \\nthat Congress intended a difference in meaning”) (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, \\n23 (1983)); accord Digital Realty Trust, Inc. v. Somers, 138 S. Ct. 767, 777 (2018). \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSecond,  the  structure  of  Section  1512  supports  the  conclusion  that  Section  1512(c)(2) \\ndefines an independent offense.  Section 1512(c)(2) delineates a complete crime with different \\nelements  from  Section  1512(c)(1)—and  each  subsection  of  Section  1512(c)  contains  its  own \\n \\n“attempt” prohibition, underscoring that they are independent prohibitions.  The two subsections \\nof  Section  1512(c)  are  connected  by  the  conjunction  “or,”  indicating  that  each  provides  an \\nalternative basis for criminal liability.  See Loughrin, 573 U.S. at 357 (“ordinary use [of ‘or’] is \\n \\nalmost  always  disjunctive,  that  is,  the  words  it  connects  are  to  be  given  separate  meanings”) \\n(internal quotation marks omitted).  In Loughrin, for example, the Supreme Court relied on the use \\n \\nof the word “or” to hold that adjacent and overlapping subsections of the bank fraud statute, 18 \\nU.S.C.  § 1344,  state  distinct  offenses  and  that  subsection  1344(2)  therefore  should  not  be \\ninterpreted to contain an additional element specified only in subsection 1344(1).  Id.; see also \\nShaw v. United States, 137 S. Ct. 462, 465-469 (2016) (recognizing that the subsections of the \\nbank  fraud  statute  “overlap  substantially”  but  identifying  distinct  circumstances  covered  by \\neach).1078  And here, as in Loughrin, Section 1512(c)’s “two clauses have separate numbers, line \\nbreaks  before,  between,  and  after  them,  and  equivalent  indentation—thus  placing  the  clauses \\nvisually on an equal footing and indicating that they have separate meanings.”  573 U.S. at 359. \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nThird, the introductory word “otherwise” in Section 1512(c)(2) signals that the provision \\ncovers obstructive acts that are different from those listed in Section 1512(c)(1).  See Black’s Law \\nDictionary 1101 (6th ed. 1990) (“otherwise” means “in a different manner; in another way, or in \\nother ways”); see also, e.g., American Heritage College Dictionary Online (“1.

See \\nReconsidering Whether the Wire Act Applies to Non-Sports Gambling (Nov. 2, 2018), slip op. 7 (relying \\non plain language); id. at 11 (finding it not “tenable to read into the second clause the qualifier ‘on any \\n \\nsporting event or contest’ that appears in the first clause”); id. at 12 (relying on Digital Realty). \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n161 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

United States, 297 U.S. 124, 128 \\n(1936) (characterizing “otherwise” as a “broad term” and holding that a statutory prohibition  on \\n \\nkidnapping  “for  ransom  or  reward  or  otherwise”  is  not  limited  by  the  words  “ransom”  and \\n“reward” to kidnappings for pecuniary benefits); Collazos v. United States, 368 F.3d 190, 200 (2d \\nCir.  2004)  (construing  “otherwise”  in  28  U.S.C.  §  2466(1)(C)  to  reach  beyond  the  “specific \\nexamples” listed in prior subsections, thereby covering the “myriad means that human ingenuity \\nmight devise to permit a person to avoid the jurisdiction of a court”); cf. Begay v. United States, \\n553 U.S. 137, 144 (2006) (recognizing that “otherwise” is defined to mean “in a different way or \\n \\nmanner,”  and  holding  that  the  word  “otherwise”  introducing  the residual  clause  in  the  Armed \\nCareer Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), can, but need not necessarily, “refer to a crime \\nthat is similar to the listed examples in some respects but different in others”).1079  The purpose of \\n \\nthe  word  “otherwise”  in  Section  1512(c)(2)  is  therefore  to  clarify  that  the  provision  covers \\nobstructive  acts  other  than  the  destruction  of  physical  evidence  with  the  intent  to  impair  its \\nintegrity  or  availability,  which  is  the  conduct  addressed  in  Section  1512(c)(1).  The  word \\n“otherwise”  does  not  signal  that  Section  1512(c)(2)  has  less  breadth  in  covering  obstructive \\nconduct than the language of the provision implies.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n2.  Judicial Decisions Support a Broad Reading of Section 1512(c)(2) \\n\\n \\n\\nCourts have not limited Section 1512(c)(2) to conduct that impairs evidence, but instead \\n \\n\\nhave read it to cover obstructive acts in any form.\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n As  one  court  explained,  “[t]his  expansive  subsection  operates  as  a  catch-all  to  cover \\n‘otherwise’ obstructive behavior that might not constitute a more specific offense like document \\n \\ndestruction, which is listed in (c)(1).”  United States v. Volpendesto, 746 F.3d 273, 286 (7th Cir. \\n2014) (some quotation marks omitted).  For example, in United States v. Ring, 628 F. Supp. 2d \\n \\n195 (D.D.C. 2009), the court rejected the argument that “§ 1512(c)(2)’s reference to conduct that \\n‘otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding’ is limited to conduct that is \\nsimilar to the type of conduct proscribed by subsection (c)(1)—namely, conduct that impairs the \\n \\nintegrity  or  availability  of  ‘record[s],  documents[s],  or  other  object[s]  for  use  in  an  official \\nproceeding.”  Id. at 224.  The court explained that “the meaning of § 1512(c)(2) is plain on its \\nface.”  Id. (alternations in original).  And courts have upheld convictions under Section 1512(c)(2) \\nthat did not involve evidence impairment, but instead resulted from conduct that more broadly \\nthwarted arrests or investigations.  See, e.g., United States v. Martinez, 862 F.3d 223, 238 (2d Cir. \\n2017) (police officer tipped off suspects about issuance of arrest warrants before “outstanding \\nwarrants  could  be  executed,  thereby  potentially  interfering  with  an  ongoing  grand  jury \\nproceeding”); United States v. Ahrensfield, 698 F.3d 1310, 1324-1326 (10th Cir. 2012) (officer \\n \\ndisclosed existence of an undercover investigation to its target); United States v. Phillips, 583 F.3d \\n1261, 1265 (10th Cir. 2009) (defendant disclosed identity of an undercover officer thus preventing \\n \\nhim from making controlled purchases from methamphetamine dealers).  Those cases illustrate \\n \\nthat Section 1512(c)(2) applies to corrupt acts—including by public officials—that frustrate the \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                            \\n\\n \\n\\n1079 In Sykes v. United States, 564 U.S. 1, 15 (2011), the Supreme Court substantially abandoned \\n \\nBegay’s reading of the residual clause, and in Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015), the Court \\ninvalidated the residual clause as unconstitutionally vague.  Begay’s analysis of the word “otherwise” is \\n \\nthus of limited value. \\n    \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n162 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim.

The \\nomnibus clause has nevertheless been construed to be “far more general in scope than the earlier \\nclauses of the statute.”  United States v. Aguilar, 515 U.S. 593, 599 (1995).  “The omnibus clause \\nis essentially a catch-all provision which generally prohibits conduct that interferes with the due \\nadministration of justice.”  United States v. Brenson, 104 F.3d 1267, 1275 (11th Cir. 1997).  Courts \\nhave accordingly given it a “non-restrictive reading.”  United States v. Kumar, 617 F.3d 612, 620 \\n(2d Cir. 2010); id. at 620 n.7 (collecting cases from the Third, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh \\nCircuits).  As one court has explained, the omnibus clause “prohibits acts that are similar in result, \\nrather than manner, to the conduct described in the first part of the statute.”  United States v. \\nHoward, 569 F.2d 1331, 1333 (5th Cir. 1978).  While the specific clauses “forbid certain means \\nof obstructing justice . . . the omnibus clause aims at obstruction of justice itself, regardless of the \\nmeans used to reach that result.”  Id. (collecting cases).  Given the similarity of Section 1512(c)(2) \\n \\nto Section 1503’s omnibus clause, Congress would have expected Section 1512(c)(2) to cover acts \\nthat produced a similar result to the evidence-impairment provisions—i.e., the result of obstructing \\njustice—rather  than  covering  only  acts  that  were  similar  in  manner.  Read  this  way,  Section \\n1512(c)(2)  serves  a  distinct  function  in  the  federal  obstruction-of-justice  statutes: \\nit  captures \\ncorrupt  conduct,  other  than  document  destruction,  that  has  the  natural  tendency  to  obstruct \\ncontemplated as well as pending proceedings.  \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n   \\n\\nSection 1512(c)(2) overlaps with other obstruction statutes, but it does not render them \\n \\nsuperfluous.  Section  1503,  for  example,  which  covers  pending  grand  jury  and  judicial \\nproceedings,  and  Section  1505,  which  covers  pending  administrative  and  congressional \\nproceedings, reach “endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede” the proceedings—a broader test \\nfor inchoate violations than Section 1512(c)(2)’s “attempt” standard, which requires a substantial \\nstep towards a completed offense.  See United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 287, 302 (2d Cir. 2018) \\n(“[E]fforts to witness tamper that rise to the level of an ‘endeavor’ yet fall short of an ‘attempt’ \\ncannot be prosecuted under § 1512.”); United States v. Leisure, 844 F.2d 1347, 1366-1367 (8th \\nCir.  1988)  (collecting  cases  recognizing  the  difference  between  the  “endeavor”  and  “attempt” \\n \\nstandards).  And  18  U.S.C.  §  1519,  which  prohibits  destruction  of  documents  or  records  in \\ncontemplation  of  an  investigation  or  proceeding,  does  not  require  the  “nexus”  showing  under \\n \\nAguilar, which Section 1512(c)(2) demands.  See, e.g., United States v. Yielding, 657 F.3d 688, \\n712 (8th Cir. 2011) (“The requisite knowledge and intent [under Section 1519] can be present even \\nif the accused lacks knowledge that he is likely to succeed in obstructing the matter.”); United \\nStates v. Gray, 642 F.3d 371, 376-377 (2d Cir. 2011) (“[I]n enacting § 1519, Congress rejected \\nany requirement that the government prove a link between a defendant’s conduct and an imminent \\nor pending official proceeding.”).  The existence of even “substantial” overlap is not “uncommon” \\n \\nin criminal statutes.  Loughrin, 573 U.S. at 359 n.4; see Shaw, 137 S. Ct. at 458-469; Aguilar, 515 \\nU.S. at 616 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (“The fact that there is now some overlap between § 1503 and \\n§ 1512 is no more intolerable than the fact that there is some overlap between the omnibus clause \\nof § 1503 and the other provisions of § 1503 itself.”).  But given that Sections 1503, 1505, and \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n163 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n1519 each reach conduct that Section 1512(c)(2) does not, the overlap provides no reason to give \\nSection 1512(c)(2) an artificially limited construction.  See Shaw, 137 S. Ct. at 469.1080 \\n \\n\\n3.  The Legislative History of Section 1512(c)(2) Does Not Justify Narrowing Its \\n\\n \\n\\nText \\n\\n \\n“Given the straightforward statutory command” in Section 1512(c)(2), “there is no reason \\nto resort to legislative history.”  United States v. Gonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 6 (1997).  In any event, the \\nlegislative history of Section 1512(c)(2) is not a reason to impose extratextual limitations on its \\n \\nreach. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nCongress enacted Section 1512(c)(2) as part the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. \\n107-204,  Tit.  XI,  §  1102,  116  Stat.  807.      The  relevant  section  of  the  statute  was  entitled \\n \\n“Tampering  with  a  Record  or  Otherwise  Impeding  an  Official  Proceeding.”  116  Stat.  807 \\n(emphasis added).  That title indicates that Congress intended the two clauses to have independent \\neffect.  Section 1512(c) was added as a floor amendment in the Senate and explained as closing a \\ncertain “loophole” with respect to “document shredding.”  See 148 Cong. Rec. S6545 (July 10, \\n2002) (Sen. Lott); id. at S6549-S6550 (Sen. Hatch). But those explanations do not limit the enacted \\ntext.  See Pittston Coal Group v. Sebben, 488 U.S. 105, 115 (1988) (“[I]t is not the law that a \\nstatute can have no effects which are not explicitly mentioned in its legislative history.”); see also \\n \\nEncino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 138 S. Ct. 1134, 1143 (2018) (“Even if Congress did not \\nforesee all of the applications of the statute, that is no reason not to give the statutory text a fair \\n \\nreading.”).  The floor statements thus cannot detract from the meaning of the enacted text.  See \\nBarnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, 457 (2002) (“Floor statements from two Senators \\n \\ncannot amend the clear and unambiguous language of a statute.  We see no reason to give greater \\nweight  to  the  views  of  two  Senators  than  to  the  collective  votes  of  both  Houses,  which  are \\nmemorialized in the unambiguous statutory text.”).  That principle has particular force where one \\n \\nof  the  proponents  of  the  amendment  to  Section  1512  introduced  his  remarks  as  only  “briefly \\nelaborat[ing] on some of the specific provisions contained in this bill.”  148 Cong. Rec. S6550 \\n(Sen. Hatch). \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIndeed,  the  language  Congress  used  in  Section  1512(c)(2)—prohibiting  “corruptly  .  .  . \\n       \\nobstruct[ing],  influenc[ing],  or  imped[ing]  any  official  proceeding”  or  attempting  to  do  so— \\nparallels  a  provision  that  Congress  considered  years  earlier  in  a  bill  designed  to  strengthen \\nprotections against witness tampering and obstruction of justice.  While the earlier provision is not \\na direct antecedent of Section 1512(c)(2), Congress’s understanding of the broad scope of the \\n                                            \\n\\n1080 The Supreme Court’s decision in Marinello v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 1101 (2018), does not \\n \\nsupport imposing a non-textual limitation on Section 1512(c)(2).  Marinello interpreted the tax obstruction \\n \\nstatute,  26  U.S.C.  §  7212(a),  to  require  “a  ‘nexus’  between  the  defendant’s  conduct  and  a  particular \\nadministrative  proceeding.”  Id.  at  1109.  The  Court  adopted  that  construction  in  light  of  the  similar \\ninterpretation given to “other obstruction provisions,” id. (citing Aguilar and Arthur Andersen), as well as \\n \\nconsiderations of context, legislative history, structure of the criminal tax laws, fair warning, and lenity.  Id. \\n \\nat 1106-1108.  The type of “nexus” element the Court adopted in Marinello already applies under Section \\n \\n1512(c)(2), and the remaining considerations the Court cited do not justify reading into Section 1512(c)(2) \\nlanguage that is not there.  See Bates v. United States, 522 U.S. 23, 29 (1997) (the Court “ordinarily resist[s] \\nreading words or elements into a statute that do not appear on its face.”).   \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n164 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nearlier provision is instructive.  Recognizing that “the proper administration of justice may be \\nimpeded or thwarted” by a “variety of corrupt methods . . . limited only by the imagination of the \\ncriminally inclined,” S. Rep. No. 532, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 17-18 (1982), Congress considered a \\n \\nbill  that  would  have  amended  Section  1512  by  making  it  a  crime,  inter  alia,  when  a  person \\n \\n“corruptly . . . influences, obstructs, or impedes . . . [t]he enforcement and prosecution of federal \\nlaw,” “administration of a law under which an official proceeding is being or may be conducted,” \\nor the “exercise of a Federal legislative power of inquiry.”  Id. at 17-19 (quoting S. 2420). \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe Senate Committee explained that: \\n\\n[T]he purpose of preventing an obstruction of or miscarriage of justice cannot be fully \\ncarried out by a simple enumeration of the commonly prosecuted obstruction offenses.  \\nThere must also be protection against the rare type of conduct that is the product of the \\n \\ninventive criminal mind and which also thwarts justice.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nId. at 18.  The report gave examples of conduct “actually prosecuted under the current residual \\nclause [in 18 U.S.C. § 1503], which would probably not be covered in this series [of provisions] \\nwithout  a  residual  clause.”  Id.  One  prominent  example  was  “[a]  conspiracy  to  cover  up  the \\n \\nWatergate burglary and its aftermath by having the Central Intelligence Agency seek to interfere \\nwith an ongoing FBI investigation of the burglary.”  Id. (citing United States v. Haldeman, 559 \\nF.2d 31 (D.C. Cir. 1976)).  The report therefore indicates a congressional awareness not only that \\n \\nresidual-clause  language  resembling  Section  1512(c)(2)  broadly  covers  a  wide  variety  of \\nobstructive  conduct,  but  also  that  such  language  reaches  the  improper  use  of  governmental \\nprocesses to obstruct justice—specifically, the Watergate cover-up orchestrated by White House \\nofficials including the President himself.

General  Principles  of  Statutory  Construction  Do  Not  Suggest  That  Section \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1512(c)(2) is Inapplicable to the Conduct in this Investigation \\n \\n\\nThe  requirement  of  fair  warning  in  criminal  law,  the  interest  in  avoiding  due  process \\n \\nconcerns in potentially vague statutes, and the rule of lenity do not justify narrowing the reach of \\nSection 1512(c)(2)’s text.1082 \\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\na.  As with other criminal laws, the Supreme Court has “exercised restraint” in interpreting \\n \\nobstruction-of-justice provisions, both out of respect for Congress’s role in defining crimes and in \\nthe  interest  of  providing  individuals  with  “fair  warning”  of  what  a  criminal  statute  prohibits. \\nMarinello  v.  United  States,  138  S.  Ct.  1101,  1106  (2018);  Arthur  Andersen,  544 U.S.  at  703; \\n                                            \\n\\n1081  The  Senate  ultimately  accepted  the  House  version  of  the  bill,  which  excluded  an  omnibus \\n \\nclause.  See United States v. Poindexter, 951 F.2d 369, 382-383 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (tracing history of the \\n \\n \\nproposed omnibus provision in the witness-protection legislation).  During the floor debate on the bill, \\nSenator Heinz, one of the initiators and primary backers of the legislation, explained that the omnibus clause \\nwas  beyond  the  scope  of  the  witness-protection  measure  at  issue  and  likely  “duplicative”  of  other \\nobstruction laws, 128 Cong. Rec. 26,810 (1982) (Sen. Heinz), presumably referring to Sections 1503 and \\n \\n1505.  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1082 In a separate section addressing considerations unique to the presidency, we consider principles \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nof statutory construction relevant in that context.  See Volume II, Section III.B.1, infra. \\n\\n \\n\\n165 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\nAguilar, 515 U.S. at 599-602.  In several obstruction cases, the Court has imposed a nexus test that \\nrequires that the wrongful conduct targeted by the provision be sufficiently connected to an official \\nproceeding to ensure the requisite culpability.  Marinello, 138 S. Ct. at 1109; Arthur Andersen, \\n544 U.S. at 707-708; Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 600-602.  Section 1512(c)(2) has been interpreted to \\n \\nrequire a similar nexus.  See, e.g., United States v. Young, 916 F.3d 368, 386 (4th Cir. 2019); \\nUnited States v. Petruk, 781 F.3d 438, 445 (8th Cir. 2015); United States v. Phillips, 583 F.3d \\n1261, 1264 (10th Cir. 2009); United States v. Reich, 479 F.3d 179, 186 (2d Cir. 2007).  To satisfy \\nthe nexus requirement, the government must show as an objective matter that a defendant acted \\n“in a manner that is likely to obstruct justice,” such that the statute “excludes defendants who have \\n \\nan  evil  purpose  but  use  means  that  would  only  unnaturally  and  improbably  be  successful.”  \\nAguilar, 515 U.S. at 601-602 (internal quotation marks omitted); see id. at 599 (“the endeavor \\nmust have the natural and probable effect of interfering with the due administration of justice”) \\n \\n(internal quotation marks omitted).  The government must also show as a subjective matter that \\n \\nthe actor “contemplated a particular, foreseeable proceeding.”  Petruk, 781 F.3d at 445.  Those \\nrequirements  alleviate  fair-warning  concerns  by  ensuring  that  obstructive  conduct  has  a  close \\nenough  connection  to  existing  or  future  proceedings  to  implicate  the  dangers  targeted  by  the \\nobstruction laws and that the individual actually has the obstructive result in mind.   \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nb.  Courts also seek to construe statutes to avoid due process vagueness concerns.  See, e.g., \\n \\nMcDonnell v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2355, 2373 (2016); Skilling v. United States, 561 U.S. 358, \\n368, 402-404 (2010).  Vagueness doctrine requires that a statute define a crime “with sufficient \\ndefiniteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited” and “in a manner that \\ndoes not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.”  Id. at 402-403 (internal quotation \\nmarks omitted).  The obstruction statutes’ requirement of acting “corruptly” satisfies that test.   \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n“Acting ‘corruptly’ within the meaning of § 1512(c)(2) means acting with an improper \\npurpose and to engage in conduct knowingly and dishonestly with the specific intent to subvert, \\nimpede or obstruct” the relevant proceeding.  United States v. Gordon, 710 F.3d 1124, 1151 (10th \\nCir. 2013) (some quotation marks omitted).  The majority opinion in Aguilar did not address the \\ndefendant’s vagueness challenge to the word “corruptly,” 515 U.S. at 600 n. 1, but Justice Scalia’s \\nseparate opinion did reach that issue and would have rejected the challenge, id. at 616-617 (Scalia, \\nJ., joined by Kennedy and Thomas, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  “Statutory \\nlanguage need not be colloquial,” Justice Scalia explained, and “the term ‘corruptly’ in criminal \\nlaws has a longstanding and well-accepted meaning.  It denotes an act done with an intent to give \\nsome  advantage  inconsistent  with  official  duty  and  the  rights  of  others.”  Id.  at  616  (internal \\n \\nquotation marks omitted; citing lower court authority and legal dictionaries).  Justice Scalia added \\nthat “in the context of obstructing jury proceedings, any claim of ignorance of wrongdoing is \\n \\nincredible.”  Id.  at  617.  Lower  courts  have  also  rejected  vagueness  challenges  to  the  word \\n“corruptly.”  See, e.g., United States v. Edwards, 869 F.3d 490, 501-502 (7th Cir. 2017); United \\n \\nStates v. Brenson, 104 F.3d 1267, 1280-1281 (11th Cir. 1997); United States v. Howard, 569 F.2d \\n1331, 1336 n.9 (5th Cir. 1978).  This well-established intent standard precludes the need to limit \\nthe obstruction statutes to only certain kinds of inherently wrongful conduct.1083 \\n   \\n\\n   \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                            \\n\\n \\n\\n1083 In United States v. Poindexter, 951 F.2d 369 (D.C. Cir. 1991), the court of appeals found the \\n \\nterm “corruptly” in  18 U.S.C. §  1505 vague as applied to a person who provided false information to \\n \\nCongress.  After suggesting that the word “corruptly” was vague on its face, 951 F.2d at 378, the court \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n166 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nc.  Finally, the rule of lenity does not justify treating Section 1512(c)(2) as a prohibition on \\nevidence  impairment,  as  opposed  to  an  omnibus  clause.  The  rule  of  lenity  is  an  interpretive \\nprinciple  that  resolves  ambiguity  in  criminal  laws  in  favor  of  the  less-severe  construction.  \\nCleveland v. United States, 531 U.S. 12, 25 (2000).  “[A]s [the Court has] repeatedly emphasized,” \\nhowever, the rule of lenity applies only if, “after considering text, structure, history and purpose, \\nthere remains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute such that the Court must simply \\nguess as to what Congress intended.”  Abramski v. United States, 573 U.S. 169, 188 n.10 (2014) \\n(internal quotation marks omitted).  The rule has been cited, for example, in adopting a narrow \\nmeaning of “tangible object” in an obstruction statute when the prohibition’s title, history, and list \\nof prohibited acts indicated a focus on destruction of records.  See Yates v. United States, 135 S. \\n \\nCt. 1074, 1088 (2015) (plurality opinion) (interpreting “tangible object” in the phrase “record, \\n \\ndocument,  or  tangible  object”  in  18  U.S.C.  § 1519  to  mean  an  item  capable  of  recording  or \\n \\npreserving  information).  Here,  as  discussed  above,  the  text,  structure,  and  history  of  Section \\n1512(c)(2)  leaves  no  “grievous  ambiguity”  about  the  statute’s  meaning.  Section  1512(c)(2) \\ndefines a structurally independent general prohibition on obstruction of official proceedings. \\n\\n \\n  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n5.  Other Obstruction Statutes Might Apply to the Conduct in this Investigation \\n\\n \\n\\nRegardless whether Section 1512(c)(2) covers all corrupt acts that obstruct, influence, or \\n \\nimpede  pending  or  contemplated  proceedings,  other  statutes  would  apply  to  such  conduct  in \\npending proceedings, provided that the remaining statutory elements are satisfied.  As discussed \\n \\nabove,  the omnibus  clause  in  18  U.S.C.  § 1503(a) applies generally to  obstruction  of  pending \\njudicial and grand proceedings.1084  See Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 598 (noting that the clause is “far \\nmore  general  in  scope”  than  preceding  provisions).  Section  1503(a)’s  protections  extend  to \\n \\nwitness tampering and to other obstructive conduct that has a nexus to pending proceedings.  See \\nSampson, 898 F.3d at 298-303 & n.6 (collecting cases from eight circuits holding that Section \\n \\n1503  covers  witness-related  obstructive  conduct,  and  cabining  prior  circuit  authority).    And \\nSection 1505 broadly criminalizes obstructive conduct aimed at pending agency and congressional \\nproceedings.1085  See, e.g., United States v. Rainey, 757 F.3d 234, 241-247 (5th Cir. 2014). \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n   \\n\\n                                            \\nconcluded that the statute did not clearly apply to corrupt conduct by the person himself and the “core” \\nconduct to which Section 1505 could constitutionally be applied was one person influencing another person \\nto  violate  a  legal  duty.  Id.  at  379-386.  Congress  later  enacted  a  provision  overturning  that  result  by \\nproviding that “[a]s used in [S]ection 1505, the term ‘corruptly’ means acting with an improper purpose, \\npersonally or by influencing another, including by making a false or misleading statement, or withholding, \\n \\nconcealing, altering, or destroying a document or other information.”  18 U.S.C. § 1515(b).  Other courts \\nhave declined to follow Poindexter either by limiting it to Section 1505 and the specific conduct at issue in \\nthat case, see Brenson, 104 F.3d at 1280-1281; reading it as narrowly limited to certain types of conduct, \\n \\nsee United States v. Morrison, 98 F.3d 619, 629-630 (D.C. Cir. 1996); or by noting that it predated Arthur \\nAndersen’s interpretation of the term “corruptly,” see Edwards, 869 F.3d at 501-502. \\n\\n    \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1084 Section 1503(a) provides for criminal punishment of:  \\n\\nWhoever  .  .  .  corruptly  or  by  threats  or  force,  or  by  any  threatening  letter  or \\n \\ncommunication, influences, obstructs, or impedes, or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or \\nimpede, the due administration of justice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1085  Section 1505 provides for criminal punishment of: \\n \\n\\n167 \\n\\n \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\nFinally,  18  U.S.C.  § 1512(b)(3)  criminalizes  tampering  with  witnesses  to  prevent  the \\ncommunication of information about a crime to law enforcement.  The nexus inquiry articulated \\nin Aguilar—that an individual has “knowledge that his actions are likely to affect the judicial \\n \\nproceeding,” 515 U.S. at 599—does not apply to Section 1512(b)(3).  See United States v. Byrne, \\n435 F.3d 16, 24-25 (1st Cir. 2006).  The nexus inquiry turns instead on the actor’s intent to prevent \\ncommunications to a federal law enforcement official.  See Fowler v. United States, 563 U.S. 668, \\n \\n673-678 (2011). \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n* \\n\\n* \\n\\n* \\n\\nIn sum, in light of the breadth of Section 1512(c)(2) and the other obstruction statutes, an \\nargument that the conduct at issue in this investigation falls outside the scope of the obstruction \\nlaws lacks merit.   \\n\\n \\nB. \\n\\nConstitutional  Defenses  to  Applying  Obstruction-Of-Justice  Statutes  to \\nPresidential Conduct \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\nThe President has broad discretion to direct criminal investigations.  The Constitution vests \\n \\nthe “executive Power” in the President and enjoins him to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully \\n \\nexecuted.”      U.S. CONST. ART  II,  §§  1,  3.  Those  powers  and  duties  form  the  foundation  of \\nprosecutorial discretion.  See United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996) (Attorney \\nGeneral and United States Attorneys “have this latitude because they are designated by statute as \\nthe President’s delegates to help him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that \\nthe Laws be faithfully executed.’”).  The President also has authority to appoint officers of the \\nUnited States and to remove those whom he has appointed.  U.S. CONST. ART II, § 2, cl. 2 (granting \\n \\nauthority to the President to appoint all officers with the advice and consent of the Senate, but \\n \\nproviding that Congress may vest the appointment of inferior officers in the President alone, the \\nheads of departments, or the courts of law); see also Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company \\nAccounting Oversight Board, 561 U.S. 477, 492-493, 509 (2010) (describing removal authority as \\n \\nflowing from the President’s “responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed”).   \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAlthough the President has broad authority under Article II, that authority coexists with \\nCongress’s  Article  I  power  to  enact  laws  that  protect  congressional  proceedings,  federal \\ninvestigations, the courts, and grand juries against corrupt efforts to undermine their functions.  \\nUsually,  those  constitutional  powers  function  in  harmony,  with  the  President  enforcing  the \\n \\n \\ncriminal laws under Article II to protect against corrupt obstructive acts.  But when the President’s \\nofficial  actions  come  into  conflict  with  the  prohibitions  in  the  obstruction  statutes,  any \\nconstitutional tension is reconciled through separation-of-powers analysis.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                            \\n\\n       \\n\\nWhoever corruptly . . . influences, obstructs, or impedes or endeavors to influence, \\n \\nobstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which any pending \\n \\nproceeding is being had before any department or agency of the United States, or the due \\nand proper exercise of the power of inquiry under which any inquiry or investigation is \\nbeing had by either House, or any committee of either House or any joint committee of the \\nCongress. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n168 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe  President’s  counsel  has  argued  that  “the  President’s  exercise  of  his  constitutional \\nauthority . . . to terminate an FBI Director and to close investigations . . . cannot constitutionally \\nconstitute  obstruction  of  justice.”1086  As  noted  above,  no  Department  of  Justice  position  or \\n \\nSupreme  Court  precedent  directly  resolved  this  issue.  We  did  not  find  counsel’s  contention, \\nhowever, to accord with our reading of the Supreme Court authority addressing separation-of-\\npowers issues.  Applying the Court’s framework for analysis, we concluded that Congress can \\nvalidly regulate the President’s exercise of official duties to prohibit actions motivated by a corrupt \\nintent to obstruct justice.  The limited effect on presidential power that results from that restriction \\nwould not impermissibly undermine the President’s ability to perform his Article II functions.      \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1.  The  Requirement  of  a  Clear  Statement  to  Apply  Statutes  to  Presidential \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nConduct Does Not Limit the Obstruction Statutes \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nBefore  addressing  Article  II  issues  directly,  we  consider  one  threshold  statutory-\\nconstruction principle that is unique to the presidency:  “The principle that general statutes must \\nbe read as not applying to the President if they do not expressly apply where application would \\narguably  limit  the  President’s  constitutional  role.”  OLC,  Application  of  28  U.S.C.  § 458  to \\nPresidential  Appointments  of  Federal  Judges,  19  Op.  O.L.C.  350,  352  (1995).  This  “clear \\nstatement rule,” id., has its source in two principles:  statutes should be construed to avoid serious \\nconstitutional questions, and Congress should not be assumed to have altered the constitutional \\nseparation of powers without clear assurance that it intended that result.  OLC, The Constitutional \\nSeparation of Powers Between the President and Congress, 20 Op. O.L.C. 124, 178 (1996). \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nThe Supreme Court has applied that clear-statement rule in several cases.  In one leading \\ncase, the Court construed the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., not to apply \\nto judicial review of presidential action.  Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 800-801 (1992).  \\nThe Court explained that it “would require an express statement by Congress before assuming it \\n \\nintended the President’s performance of his statutory duties to be reviewed for abuse of discretion.”  \\nId. at 801.  In another case, the Court interpreted the word “utilized” in the Federal Advisory \\nCommittee  Act  (FACA),  5  U.S.C.  App.,  to  apply  only  to  the  use  of  advisory  committees \\nestablished  directly  or  indirectly  by  the  government,  thereby  excluding  the  American  Bar \\nAssociation’s advice to the Department of Justice about federal judicial candidates.  Public Citizen \\n \\nv. United States Department of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 455, 462-467 (1989).  The Court explained \\nthat a broader interpretation of the term “utilized” in FACA would raise serious questions whether \\nthe statute “infringed unduly on the President’s Article II power to nominate federal judges and \\nviolated  the  doctrine  of  separation  of  powers.”  Id.  at  466-467.  Another  case  found  that  an \\nestablished canon of statutory construction applied with “special force” to provisions that would \\nimpinge on the President’s foreign-affairs powers if construed broadly.  Sale v. Haitian Centers \\nCouncil, 509 U.S. 155, 188 (1993) (applying the presumption against extraterritorial application \\n \\nto construe the Refugee Act of 1980 as not governing in an overseas context where it could affect \\n“foreign and military affairs for which the President has unique responsibility”).

O.L.C. at 353-354 \\n(discussing Franklin, Public Citizen, and Sale). \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe Department of Justice has relied on this clear-statement principle to interpret certain \\nstatutes as not applying to the President at all, similar to the approach taken in Franklin.  See, e.g., \\nMemorandum  for  Richard  T.  Burress,  Office  of  the  President,  from  Laurence  H.  Silberman, \\nDeputy  Attorney  General,  Re:    Conflict  of  Interest  Problems  Arising  out  of  the  President’s \\n \\nNomination of Nelson A. Rockefeller to be Vice President under the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to \\nthe Constitution, at 2, 5 (Aug. 28, 1974) (criminal conflict-of-interest statute, 18 U.S.C. § 208, \\ndoes not apply to the President).  Other OLC opinions interpret statutory text not to apply to certain \\n \\npresidential or executive actions because of constitutional concerns.  See Application of 28 U.S.C. \\n§ 458 to Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 Op. O.L.C. at 350-357 (consanguinity \\nlimitations  on  court  appointments,  28  U.S.C.  §  458,  found  inapplicable  to  “presidential \\nappointments of judges to the federal judiciary”); Constraints Imposed by 18 U.S.C. § 1913 on \\nLobbying Efforts, 13 Op. O.L.C. 300, 304-306 (1989) (limitation on the use of appropriated funds \\nfor certain lobbying programs found inapplicable to certain communications by the President and \\nexecutive officials).  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nBut OLC has also recognized that this clear-statement rule “does not apply with respect to \\na statute that raises no separation of powers questions were it to be applied to the President,” such \\nas the federal bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. § 201.  Application of 28 U.S.C. § 458 to Presidential \\nAppointments of Federal Judges, 19 Op. O.L.C. at 357 n.11.  OLC explained that “[a]pplication \\n \\nof  §  201  raises  no  separation  of  powers  question,  let  alone  a  serious  one,”  because  [t]he \\nConstitution confers no power in the President to receive bribes.” Id. In support of that conclusion, \\n \\nOLC noted constitutional provisions that forbid increases in the President’s compensation while \\n \\nin office, “which is what a bribe would function to do,” id. (citing U.S. CONST. ART. II, § 1, cl. 7), \\nand the express constitutional power of “Congress to impeach [and convict] a President for, inter \\n \\nalia, bribery,” id. (citing U.S. CONST.

See Application of 28 U.S.C. \\n§ 458  to  Presidential  Appointments  of  Federal  Judges,  19  Op.  O.L.C.  at  357  n.11.  The \\nConstitution does not authorize the President to engage in such conduct, and those actions would \\ntransgress the President’s duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”  U.S. CONST. \\n \\nART II, §§ 3.  In view of those clearly permissible applications of the obstruction statutes to the \\n \\nPresident, Franklin’s holding that the President is entirely excluded from a statute absent a clear \\n \\nstatement would not apply in this context.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nA more limited application of a clear-statement rule to exclude from the obstruction statutes \\nonly certain acts by the President—for example, removing prosecutors or ending investigations \\n \\nfor corrupt reasons—would be difficult to implement as a matter of statutory interpretation.  It is \\nnot  obvious  how  a  clear-statement  rule  would  apply  to  an  omnibus  provision  like  Section \\n \\n1512(c)(2) to exclude corruptly motivated obstructive acts only when carried out in the President’s \\n \\nconduct of office.  No statutory term could easily bear that specialized meaning.  For example, the \\nword “corruptly” has a well-established meaning that does not exclude exercises of official power \\nfor corrupt ends.  Indeed, an established definition states that “corruptly” means action with an \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n170 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

And it would be contrary \\nto ordinary rules of statutory construction to adopt an unconventional meaning of a statutory term \\nonly  when  applied  to  the  President.  See  United  States  v.  Santos,  553  U.S.  507,  522  (2008) \\n \\n(plurality opinion of Scalia, J.) (rejecting proposal to “giv[e] the same word, in the same statutory \\nprovision, different meanings in different factual contexts”); cf.  Public Citizen, 491 U.S. at 462-\\n467 (giving the term “utilized” in the FACA a uniform meaning to avoid constitutional questions). \\n  \\nNor  could  such  an  exclusion  draw  on  a  separate  and  established  background  interpretive \\npresumption, such as the presumption against extraterritoriality applied in Sale.  The principle that \\ncourts will construe a statute to avoid serious constitutional questions “is not a license for the \\n \\njudiciary to rewrite language enacted by the legislature.”  Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, \\n59-60  (1997).  “It  is  one  thing  to  acknowledge  and  accept  .  .  .  well  defined  (or  even  newly \\n \\nenunciated), generally applicable, background principles of assumed legislative intent.  It is quite \\nanother to espouse the broad proposition that criminal statutes do not have to be read as broadly \\nas they are written, but are subject to case-by-case exceptions.”  Brogan v. United States, 522 U.S. \\n398, 406 (1998). \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen a proposed construction “would thus function as an extra-textual limit on [a statute’s] \\ncompass,” thereby preventing the statute “from applying to a host of cases falling within its clear \\n \\nterms,” Loughrin, 573 U.S. at 357, it is doubtful that the construction would reflect Congress’s \\nintent.  That is particularly so with respect to obstruction statutes, which “have been given a broad \\n \\nand all-inclusive meaning.”  Rainey, 757 F.3d at 245 (discussing Sections 1503 and 1505) (internal \\n \\nquotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, since no established principle of interpretation would \\nexclude the presidential conduct we have investigated from statutes such as Sections 1503, 1505, \\n1512(b), and 1512(c)(2), we proceed to examine the separation-of-powers issues that could be \\nraised as an Article II defense to the application of those statutes.   \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n2.  Separation-of-Powers  Principles  Support  the  Conclusion  that  Congress  May \\n \\nValidly Prohibit Corrupt Obstructive Acts Carried Out Through the President’s \\nOfficial Powers \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen Congress imposes a limitation on the exercise of Article II powers, the limitation’s \\nvalidity depends on whether the measure “disrupts the balance between the coordinate branches.”  \\nNixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. 425, 443 (1977).  “Even when a branch does \\n \\nnot arrogate power to itself, . . . the separation-of-powers doctrine requires that a branch not impair \\nanother in the performance of its constitutional duties.”  Loving v. United States, 517 U.S. 748, \\n757 (1996).  The “separation of powers does not mean,” however, “that the branches ‘ought to \\nhave no partial agency in, or no controul over the acts of each other.’”  Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. \\n681, 703 (1997) (quoting James Madison, The Federalist No. 47, pp. 325–326 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) \\n(emphasis omitted)).  In this context, a balancing test applies to assess separation-of-powers issues.  \\nApplying  that  test  here,  we  concluded  that  Congress  can  validly  make  obstruction-of-justice \\nstatutes  applicable  to  corruptly  motivated  official  acts  of  the  President  without  impermissibly \\nundermining his Article II functions. \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n171 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

The Supreme Court’s Separation-of-Powers Balancing Test Applies \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIn This Context \\n\\nA congressionally imposed limitation on presidential action is assessed to determine “the \\nextent to which it prevents the Executive Branch from accomplishing its constitutionally assigned \\n \\nfunctions,” and, if the “potential for disruption is present[,] . . . whether that impact is justified by \\nan  overriding  need  to  promote  objectives  within  the  constitutional  authority  of  Congress.” \\nAdministrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 443; see Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731,753-\\n754 (1982); United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 706-707 (1974).  That balancing test applies to \\n \\na congressional regulation of presidential power through the obstruction-of-justice laws. 1087 \\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen an Article II power has not been “explicitly assigned by the text of the Constitution \\nto be within the sole province of the President, but rather was thought to be encompassed within \\nthe general grant to the President of the ‘executive Power,’” the Court has balanced competing \\nconstitutional considerations.  Public Citizen, 491 U.S. at 484 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the \\n \\njudgment, joined by Rehnquist, C.J., and O’Connor, J.).  As Justice Kennedy noted in Public \\nCitizen, the Court has applied a balancing test to restrictions on “the President’s power to remove \\nExecutive officers, a power [that] . . . is not conferred by any explicit provision in the text of the \\nConstitution (as is the appointment power), but rather is inferred to be a necessary part of the grant \\nof the ‘executive Power.’”  Id. (citing Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 694 (1988), and Myers v. \\nUnited States, 272 U.S. 52, 115–116 (1926)).  Consistent with that statement, Morrison sustained \\n \\na  good-cause  limitation  on  the  removal  of  an  inferior  officer  with  defined  prosecutorial \\nresponsibilities  after  determining  that  the  limitation  did  not  impermissibly  undermine  the \\nPresident’s ability to perform his Article II functions.  487 U.S. at 691-693, 695-696.  The Court \\nhas also evaluated other general executive-power claims through a balancing test.  For example, \\nthe Court evaluated the President’s claim of an absolute privilege for presidential communications \\n \\nabout his official acts by balancing that interest against the Judicial Branch’s need for evidence in \\na criminal case.  United States v. Nixon, supra (recognizing a qualified constitutional privilege for \\npresidential communications on official matters).  The Court has also upheld a law that provided \\nfor archival access to presidential records despite a claim of absolute presidential privilege over \\n \\nthe records.  Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 443-445, 451-455.  The analysis in \\nthose  cases  supports  applying  a  balancing  test  to  assess  the  constitutionality  of  applying  the \\nobstruction-of-justice statutes to presidential exercises of executive power.  \\n\\n   \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nOnly in a few instances has the Court applied a different framework.  When the President’s \\npower is “both ‘exclusive’ and ‘conclusive’ on the issue,” Congress is precluded from regulating \\nits exercise.  Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 135 S. Ct. 2076, 2084 (2015).  In Zivotofsky, for example, the \\nCourt followed “Justice Jackson’s familiar tripartite framework” in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. \\nv. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635-638 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring), and held that the President’s \\n                                            \\n \\n\\n1087  OLC applied such a balancing test in concluding that the President is not subject to criminal \\nprosecution while in office, relying on many of the same precedents discussed in this section.  See A Sitting \\nPresident’s Amenability to Indictment and Criminal Prosecution, 24 Op. O.L.C. 222, 237-238, 244-245 \\n \\n(2000) (relying on, inter alia, United States v. Nixon, Nixon v. Fitzgerald, and Clinton v. Jones, and quoting \\nthe  legal  standard  from  Administrator  of  General  Services  v.  Nixon  that  is  applied  in  the  text).  OLC \\nrecognized that “[t]he balancing analysis” it had initially relied on in finding that a sitting President is \\nimmune from prosecution had “been adopted as the appropriate mode of analysis by the Court.”  Id. at 244.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n172 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

See also Public Citizen 491 \\nU.S. at 485-486 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment) (citing the power to grant pardons under \\nU.S. CONST., ART. II, § 2, cl. 1, and the Presentment Clauses for legislation, U.S. CONST., ART.

Zivotofsky, 135 S. Ct. at 2087.  For example, although the President’s \\npower to grant pardons is exclusive and not subject to congressional regulation, see United States \\nv. Klein, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 128, 147-148 (1872), Congress has the authority to prohibit the corrupt \\nuse of “anything of value” to influence the testimony of another person in a judicial, congressional, \\nor agency proceeding, 18 U.S.C. § 201(b)(3)—which would include the offer or promise of a \\n \\npardon to induce a person to testify falsely or not to testify at all.  The offer of a pardon would \\nprecede the act of pardoning and thus be within Congress’s power to regulate even if the pardon \\n \\nitself is not.  Just as the Speech or Debate Clause, U.S. CONST. ART. I, § 6, cl.1, absolutely protects \\nlegislative acts, but not a legislator’s “taking or agreeing to take money for a promise to act in a \\ncertain way . . . for it is taking the bribe, not performance of the illicit compact, that is a criminal \\nact,” United States v. Brewster, 408 U.S. 501, 526 (1972) (emphasis omitted), the promise of a \\n \\npardon  to  corruptly  influence  testimony  would  not  be  a  constitutionally  immunized  act.  The \\napplication of obstruction statutes to such promises therefore would raise no serious separation-\\nof-powers issue. \\n\\n     \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nb.  The  Effect  of  Obstruction-of-Justice  Statutes  on  the  President’s \\n\\nCapacity to Perform His Article II Responsibilities is Limited \\n\\n \\n\\nUnder the Supreme Court’s balancing test for analyzing separation-of-powers issues, the \\nfirst task is to assess the degree to which applying obstruction-of-justice statutes to presidential \\nactions affects the President’s ability to carry out his Article II responsibilities.   Administrator of \\n \\nGeneral Services, 433 U.S. at 443.  As discussed above, applying obstruction-of-justice statutes \\nto presidential conduct that does not involve the President’s conduct of office—such as influencing \\nthe testimony of witnesses—is constitutionally unproblematic.  The President has no more right \\nthan other citizens to impede official proceedings by corruptly influencing witness testimony.  The \\nconduct would be equally improper whether effectuated through direct efforts to produce false \\ntestimony  or  suppress  the  truth,  or  through  the  actual,  threatened,  or  promised  use  of  official \\npowers to achieve the same result.      \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nThe President’s action in curtailing criminal investigations or prosecutions, or discharging \\nlaw enforcement officials, raises different questions.   Each type of action involves the exercise of \\n \\nexecutive discretion in furtherance of the President’s duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully \\nexecuted.”  U.S. CONST., ART. II, § 3.  Congress may not supplant the President’s exercise of \\n \\n \\nexecutive power to supervise prosecutions or to remove officers who occupy law enforcement \\npositions.  See Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 726-727 (1986) (“Congress cannot reserve for \\n \\nitself  the  power  of  removal  of  an  officer  charged  with  the  execution  of  the  laws  except  by \\n \\nimpeachment. . . . [Because t]he structure of the Constitution does not permit Congress to execute \\nthe  laws,  .  .  .  [t]his  kind  of  congressional  control  over  the  execution  of  the  laws  .  .  .  is \\n \\nconstitutionally impermissible.”).  Yet the obstruction-of-justice statutes do not aggrandize power \\nin Congress or usurp executive authority.  Instead, they impose a discrete limitation on conduct \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n173 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

The obstruction statutes thus \\nwould restrict presidential action only by prohibiting the President from acting to obstruct official \\nproceedings for the improper purpose of protecting his own interests.  See Volume II, Section \\n \\nIII.A.3, supra. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe direct effect on the President’s freedom of action would correspondingly be a limited \\none.  A preclusion of “corrupt” official action is not a major intrusion on Article II powers.  For \\n \\n \\nexample, the proper supervision of criminal law does not demand freedom for the President to act \\nwith the intention of shielding himself from criminal punishment, avoiding financial liability, or \\npreventing  personal  embarrassment.  To  the  contrary,  a  statute  that  prohibits  official  action \\nundertaken for such personal purposes furthers, rather than hinders, the impartial and evenhanded \\nadministration  of  the  law.  And  the  Constitution  does  not  mandate  that  the  President  have \\n \\nunfettered authority to direct investigations or prosecutions, with no limits whatsoever, in order to \\ncarry out his Article II functions.  See Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 833 (1985) (“Congress \\nmay limit an agency’s exercise of enforcement power if it wishes, either by setting substantive \\npriorities, or by otherwise circumscribing an agency’s power to discriminate among issues or cases \\nit will pursue.”); United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 707 (“[t]o read the Art. II powers of the \\nPresident  as  providing  an  absolute  privilege  [to  withhold  confidential  communications  from a \\n \\ncriminal trial]. . . would upset the constitutional balance of ‘a workable government’ and gravely \\nimpair the role of the courts under Art. III”).   \\n\\n     \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nNor must the President have unfettered authority to remove all Executive Branch officials \\n \\ninvolved in the execution of the laws.  The Constitution establishes that Congress has legislative \\nauthority  to  structure  the  Executive  Branch  by  authorizing  Congress  to  create  executive \\ndepartments and officer positions and to specify how inferior officers are appointed.  E.g., U.S. \\n \\nCONST., ART. I, § 8, cl. 18 (Necessary and Proper Clause); ART. II, § 2, cl. 1 (Opinions Clause); \\n \\nART. II, § 2, cl. 2 (Appointments Clause); see Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 499.  While the \\nPresident’s removal power is an important means of ensuring that officers faithfully execute the \\n \\nlaw, Congress has a recognized authority to place certain limits on removal.  Id. at 493-495. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe President’s removal powers are at their zenith with respect to principal officers—that \\n \\nis, officers who must be appointed by the President and who report to him directly.  See Free \\nEnterprise  Fund,  561  U.S.  at  493,  500.  The  President’s  “exclusive  and  illimitable  power  of \\nremoval” of those principal officers furthers “the President’s ability to ensure that the laws are \\nfaithfully executed.”  Id. at 493, 498 (internal quotation marks omitted); Myers, 272 U.S. at 627.  \\nThus, “there are some ‘purely executive’ officials who must be removable by the President at will \\nif he is able to accomplish his constitutional role.”  Morrison, 487 U.S. at 690; Myers, 272 U.S. at \\n134 (the President’s “cabinet officers must do his will,” and “[t]he moment that he loses confidence \\nin the intelligence, ability, judgment, or loyalty of any one of them, he must have the power to \\nremove  him  without  delay”);  cf.  Humphrey’s  Executor  v.  United  States,  295  U.S.  602  (1935) \\n(Congress has the power to create independent agencies headed by principal officers removable \\nonly for good cause).  In light of those constitutional precedents, it may be that the obstruction \\nstatutes could not be constitutionally applied to limit the removal of a cabinet officer such as the \\nAttorney  General.  See  5  U.S.C.  §  101;  28  U.S.C.  §  503. \\nIn  that  context,  at  least  absent \\n \\ncircumstances  showing  that  the  President  was  clearly  attempting  to  thwart  accountability  for \\npersonal conduct while evading ordinary political checks and balances, even the highly limited \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n174 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

United States, 520 U.S. 651, 663 (1997)) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Supreme \\n \\nCourt has long recognized Congress’s authority to place for-cause limitations on the President’s \\nremoval of “inferior Officers” whose appointment may be vested in the head of a department.  U.S. \\n \\nCONST.  ART.  II,  §  2,  cl.  2.  See  United  States  v.  Perkins,  116  U.S.  483,  485  (1886)  (“The \\nconstitutional authority in Congress to thus vest the appointment [of inferior officers in the heads \\nof  departments]  implies  authority  to  limit,  restrict,  and  regulate  the  removal  by  such  laws  as \\nCongress  may  enact  in  relation  to  the  officers  so  appointed”)  (quoting  lower  court  decision); \\nMorrison, 487 U.S. at 689 n. 27 (citing Perkins); accord id. at 723-724 & n.4 (Scalia, J., dissenting) \\n(recognizing that Perkins is “established” law); see also Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 493-\\n495 (citing Perkins and Morrison).  The category of inferior officers includes both the FBI Director \\nand the Special Counsel, each of whom reports to the Attorney General.  See 28 U.S.C. §§ 509, \\n515(a), 531; 28 C.F.R. Part 600.  Their work is thus “directed and supervised” by a presidentially-\\nappointed, Senate-confirmed officer.  See In re: Grand Jury Investigation, __ F.3d __, 2019 WL \\n \\n921692, at *3-*4 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 26, 2019) (holding that the Special Counsel is an “inferior officer” \\n \\nfor constitutional purposes). \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n     \\n\\nWhere the Constitution permits Congress to impose a good-cause limitation on the removal \\nof an Executive Branch officer, the Constitution should equally permit Congress to bar removal \\nfor  the  corrupt  purpose  of  obstructing  justice.  Limiting  the  range  of  permissible  reasons  for \\nremoval to exclude a “corrupt” purpose imposes a lesser restraint on the President than requiring \\nan affirmative showing of good cause.  It follows that for such inferior officers, Congress may \\nconstitutionally restrict the President’s removal authority if that authority was exercised for the \\ncorrupt purpose of obstructing justice.  And even if a particular inferior officer’s position might be \\n \\nof  such  importance  to  the  execution  of  the  laws  that  the  President  must  have  at-will  removal \\nauthority,  the  obstruction-of-justice  statutes  could  still  be  constitutionally  applied  to  forbid \\n \\nremoval for a corrupt reason.1088  A narrow and discrete limitation on removal that precluded \\ncorrupt action would leave ample room for all other considerations, including disagreement over \\n \\npolicy  or  loss  of  confidence  in  the  officer’s  judgment  or  commitment.  A  corrupt-purpose \\nprohibition  therefore  would  not  undermine  the  President’s  ability  to  perform  his  Article  II \\nfunctions.  Accordingly,  because  the  separation-of-powers  question  is  “whether  the  removal \\nrestrictions  are  of  such  a  nature  that  they  impede  the  President’s  ability  to  perform  his \\nconstitutional duty,” Morrison, 487 U.S. at 691, a restriction on removing an inferior officer for a \\n                                            \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1088 Although the FBI director is an inferior officer, he is appointed by the President and removable \\n \\nby him at will, see 28 U.S.C. § 532 note, and it is not clear that Congress could constitutionally provide the \\nFBI director with good-cause tenure protection.

Congress  Has  Power  to  Protect  Congressional,  Grand  Jury,  and \\n\\nJudicial Proceedings Against Corrupt Acts from Any Source \\n\\n \\n\\nWhere  a  law  imposes  a  burden  on  the  President’s  performance  of Article II  functions, \\nseparation-of-powers  analysis  considers  whether  the  statutory  measure  “is  justified  by  an \\n \\noverriding  need  to  promote  objectives  within  the  constitutional  authority  of  Congress.”  \\nAdministrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 443.  Here, Congress enacted the obstruction-of-\\njustice statutes to protect, among other things, the integrity of its own proceedings, grand jury \\ninvestigations, and federal criminal trials.  Those objectives are within Congress’s authority and \\nserve strong governmental interests.    \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\ni.  Congress has Article I authority to define generally applicable criminal law and apply it \\nto  all  persons—including  the  President.  Congress  clearly  has  authority  to  protect  its  own \\nlegislative  functions  against  corrupt  efforts  designed  to  impede  legitimate  fact-gathering  and \\n \\nlawmaking efforts.  See Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. 178, 187, 206-207 (1957); Chapman \\nv. United States, 5 App. D.C. 122, 130 (1895).  Congress also has authority to establish a system \\n \\nof federal courts, which includes the power to protect the judiciary against obstructive acts.  See \\n \\nU.S. CONST. ART. I, § 8, cls. 9, 18 (“The Congress shall have Power . . . To constitute Tribunals \\n \\ninferior to the supreme Court” and “To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for \\n \\ncarrying into Execution the foregoing powers”).  The long lineage of the obstruction-of-justice \\nstatutes, which can be traced to at least 1831, attests to the necessity for that protection.  See An \\nAct Declaratory of the Law Concerning Contempts of Court, 4 Stat. 487-488 § 2 (1831) (making \\nit a crime if “any person or persons  shall corruptly . . . endeavor to influence, intimidate, or impede \\n \\nany juror, witness, or officer, in any court of the United States, in the discharge of his duty, or \\nshall, corruptly . . . obstruct, or impede, or endeavor to obstruct or impede, the due administration \\nof justice therein”). \\n\\n     \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nii.  The  Article  III  courts  have  an  equally  strong  interest  in  being  protected  against \\nobstructive acts, whatever their source.  As the Supreme Court explained in United States v. Nixon, \\na “primary constitutional duty of the Judicial Branch” is “to do justice in criminal prosecutions.”  \\n418 U.S. at 707; accord  Cheney v. United States District Court for the District of Columbia, 542 \\nU.S. 367, 384 (2004).  In Nixon, the Court rejected the President’s claim of absolute executive \\nprivilege  because  “the  allowance  of  the  privilege  to  withhold  evidence  that  is  demonstrably \\n                                            \\n\\n1089  The obstruction statutes do not disqualify the President from acting in a case simply because \\n \\nhe has a personal interest in it or because his own conduct may be at issue.  As the Department of Justice \\nhas made clear, a claim of a conflict of interest, standing alone, cannot deprive the President of the ability \\nto  fulfill  his  constitutional  function.  See,  e.g.,  OLC,  Application  of  28  U.S.C.  §  458  to  Presidential \\nAppointments of Federal Judges, 19 O.L.C. Op. at 356 (citing Memorandum for Richard T. Burress, Office \\n \\nof the President, from Laurence H. Silberman, Deputy Attorney General, Re:  Conflict of Interest Problems \\nArising out of the President’s Nomination of Nelson A. Rockefeller to be Vice President under the Twenty-\\nFifth Amendment to the Constitution, at 2, 5 (Aug. 28, 1974)).  \\n \\n\\n   \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n176 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

As  Nixon  illustrates,  the  need  to \\n \\nsafeguard judicial integrity is a compelling constitutional interest.  See id. at 709 (noting that the \\ndenial of full disclosure of the facts surrounding relevant presidential communications threatens \\n“[t]he very integrity of the judicial system and public confidence in the system”).   \\n\\n \\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\niii.  Finally, the grand jury cannot achieve its constitutional purpose absent protection from \\n \\ncorrupt acts.  Serious federal criminal charges generally reach the Article III courts based on an \\nindictment issued by a grand jury.  Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U.S. 323, 327 (1940) (“The \\n \\nConstitution itself makes the grand jury a part of the judicial process.”).  And the grand jury’s \\nfunction is enshrined in the Fifth Amendment.  U.S. CONST. AMEND. V. (“[n]o person shall be held \\nto answer” for a serious crime “unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury”).  “[T]he \\nwhole  theory  of  [the  grand  jury’s] function  is  that  it  belongs  to  no  branch  of the  institutional \\ngovernment,  serving  as  a  kind  of  buffer  or  referee  between  the  Government  and  the  people,” \\nUnited States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 47 (1992), “pledged to indict no one because of prejudice \\nand to free no one because of special favor.”  Costello v. United States, 350 U.S. 359, 362 (1956).  \\nIf the grand jury were not protected against corrupt interference from all persons, its function as \\nan independent charging body would be thwarted.  And an impartial grand jury investigation to \\ndetermine whether probable cause exists to indict is vital to the criminal justice process.   \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n* \\n\\n* \\n\\n* \\n\\n \\n\\nThe final step in the constitutional balancing process is to assess whether the separation-\\nof-powers  doctrine  permits  Congress  to  take  action  within  its  constitutional  authority \\n \\nnotwithstanding  the  potential  impact  on  Article  II  functions.  See  Administrator  of  General \\nServices, 433 U.S. at 443; see also Morrison, 487 U.S. at 691-693, 695-696; United States v. Nixon, \\n418  U.S.  at  711-712.  In  the  case  of  the  obstruction-of-justice  statutes,  our  assessment  of  the \\n \\nweighing of interests leads us to conclude that Congress has the authority to impose the limited \\nrestrictions contained in those statutes on the President’s official conduct to protect the integrity \\nof important functions of other branches of government.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nA general ban on corrupt action does not unduly intrude on the President’s responsibility \\nto “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”  U.S. CONST. ART II, §§ 3.1090  To the contrary, \\n \\nthe concept of “faithful execution” connotes the use of power in the interest of the public, not in \\nthe  office  holder’s  personal  interests.  See  1  Samuel  Johnson,  A  Dictionary  of  the  English \\nLanguage 763 (1755) (“faithfully” def. 3: “[w]ith strict adherence to duty and allegiance”).  And \\nimmunizing  the  President  from  the  generally  applicable  criminal  prohibition  against  corrupt \\n \\nobstruction of official proceedings would seriously impair Congress’s power to enact laws “to \\npromote objectives within [its] constitutional authority,” Administrator of General Services, 433 \\nU.S. at 425—i.e., protecting the integrity of its own proceedings and the proceedings of Article III \\n \\ncourts and grand juries. \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                            \\n\\na unique constitutional status.  \\n\\n1090 As noted above, the President’s selection and removal of principal executive officers may have \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n177 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\nAccordingly, based on the analysis above, we were not persuaded by the argument that the \\nPresident  has  blanket  constitutional  immunity  to  engage  in  acts  that  would  corruptly  obstruct \\njustice through the exercise of otherwise-valid Article II powers. 1091 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n3.  Ascertaining Whether the President Violated the Obstruction Statutes Would \\n \\n\\n \\nNot Chill his Performance of his Article II Duties  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nApplying  the  obstruction  statutes  to  the  President’s  official  conduct  would  involve \\ndetermining as a factual matter whether he engaged in an obstructive act, whether the act had a \\n \\nnexus to official proceedings, and whether he was motivated by corrupt intent.  But applying those \\n \\nstandards to the President’s official conduct should not hinder his ability to perform his Article II \\nduties.  Cf. Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 752-753 & n.32 (taking into account chilling effect on \\nthe President in adopting a constitutional rule of presidential immunity from private civil damages \\n \\naction based on official duties).  Several safeguards would prevent a chilling effect:  the existence \\nof settled legal standards, the presumption of regularity in prosecutorial actions, and the existence \\nof evidentiary limitations on probing the President’s motives.  And historical experience confirms \\n \\nthat no impermissible chill should exist. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\na.    As  an  initial  matter,  the  term  “corruptly”  sets  a  demanding  standard.  It  requires  a \\nconcrete showing that a person acted with an intent to obtain an “improper advantage for [him]self \\nor someone else, inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others.”  BALLENTINE’S LAW \\n \\nDICTIONARY 276 (3d ed. 1969); see United States v. Pasha, 797 F.3d 1122, 1132 (D.C. Cir. 2015); \\n \\nAguilar, 515 U.S. at 616 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  That standard \\nparallels the President’s constitutional obligation to ensure the faithful execution of the laws.  And \\nvirtually  everything  that  the  President  does  in  the  routine  conduct  of  office  will  have  a  clear \\n \\ngovernmental purpose and will not be contrary to his official duty.  Accordingly, the President has \\nno reason to be chilled in those actions because, in virtually all instances, there will be no credible \\nbasis for suspecting a corrupt personal motive.    \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThat  point  is  illustrated  by  examples  of  conduct  that  would  and  would  not  satisfy  the \\nstringent corrupt-motive standard.  Direct or indirect action by the President to end a criminal \\ninvestigation  into  his  own  or  his  family  members’  conduct  to  protect  against  personal \\nembarrassment or legal liability would constitute a core example of corruptly motivated conduct.  \\nSo too would action to halt an enforcement proceeding that directly and adversely affected the \\nPresident’s financial interests for the purpose of protecting those interests.  In those examples, \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                            \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1091 A possible remedy through impeachment for abuses of power would not substitute for potential \\n \\ncriminal liability after a President leaves office.  Impeachment would remove a President from office, but \\nwould not address the underlying culpability of the conduct or serve the usual purposes of the criminal law.  \\nIndeed,  the  Impeachment  Judgment  Clause  recognizes  that  criminal  law  plays  an  independent  role  in \\naddressing an official’s conduct, distinct from the political remedy of impeachment.  See U.S. CONST. ART. \\n \\nI, § 3, cl. 7.  Impeachment is also a drastic and rarely invoked remedy, and Congress is not restricted to \\nrelying only on impeachment, rather than making criminal law applicable to a former President, as OLC \\n \\nhas recognized.  A Sitting President’s Amenability to Indictment and Criminal Prosecution, 24 Op. O.L.C. \\nat  255  (“Recognizing  an  immunity  from  prosecution  for  a  sitting  President  would  not  preclude  such \\n \\nprosecution once the President’s term is over or he is otherwise removed from office by resignation or \\n \\nimpeachment.”).    \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n178 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nofficial power is being used for the purpose of protecting the President’s personal interests.  In \\ncontrast, the President’s actions to serve political or policy interests would not qualify as corrupt.  \\nThe  President’s  role  as  head  of  the  government  necessarily  requires  him  to  take  into  account \\npolitical factors in making policy decisions that affect law-enforcement actions and proceedings.  \\nFor  instance,  the  President’s  decision  to  curtail  a  law-enforcement  investigation  to  avoid \\ninternational friction would not implicate the obstruction-of-justice statutes.  The criminal law \\ndoes not seek to regulate the consideration of such political or policy factors in the conduct of \\ngovernment.   And when legitimate interests animate the President’s conduct, those interests will \\nalmost  invariably  be  readily  identifiable  based  on  objective  factors.  Because  the  President’s \\n \\nconduct in  those  instances  will  obviously  fall  outside  the  zone  of  obstruction law, no  chilling \\nconcern should arise. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nb.  There is also no reason to believe that investigations, let alone prosecutions, would \\noccur except in highly unusual circumstances when a credible factual basis exists to believe that \\nobstruction  occurred.  Prosecutorial  action  enjoys  a  presumption  of  regularity:  absent  “clear \\nevidence to the contrary, courts presume that [prosecutors] have properly discharged their official \\nduties.”  Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464 (quoting United States v. Chemical Foundation, Inc., 272 \\nU.S. 1, 14–15 (1926)).  The presumption of prosecutorial regularity would provide even greater \\nprotection to the President than exists in routine cases given the prominence and sensitivity of any \\nmatter involving the President and the likelihood that such matters will be subject to thorough and \\ncareful review at the most senior levels of the Department of Justice.  Under OLC’s opinion that a \\n \\nsitting President is entitled to immunity from indictment, only a successor Administration would \\nbe able to prosecute a former President.  But that consideration does not suggest that a President \\n \\nwould have any basis for fearing abusive investigations or prosecutions after leaving office.  There \\n \\nare “obvious political checks” against initiating a baseless investigation or prosecution of a former \\n \\nPresident.  See Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 448 (considering political checks \\nin separation-of-powers analysis).  And the Attorney General holds “the power to conduct the \\ncriminal litigation of the United States Government,” United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 694 \\n(citing  28  U.S.C.  §  516),  which  provides  a  strong  institutional  safeguard  against  politicized \\ninvestigations or prosecutions. 1092 \\n\\n    \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                            \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1092  Similar  institutional  safeguards  protect  Department  of  Justice  officers  and  line  prosecutors \\n \\nagainst  unfounded  investigations  into  prosecutorial  acts.  Prosecutors  are  generally  barred  from \\nparticipating in matters implicating their personal interests, see 28 C.F.R. § 45.2, and are instructed not to \\n \\n \\nbe  influenced  by  their  “own  professional  or  personal  circumstances,”  Justice  Manual  §  9-27.260,  so \\nprosecutors would not frequently be in a position to take action that could be perceived as corrupt and \\npersonally motivated.  And if such cases arise, criminal investigation would be conducted by responsible \\n \\nofficials at the Department of Justice, who can be presumed to refrain from pursuing an investigation absent \\na  credible  factual  basis.  Those  facts  distinguish  the  criminal  context  from  the  common-law  rule  of \\n \\nprosecutorial immunity, which protects against the threat of suit by “a defendant [who] often will transform \\nhis  resentment  at  being  prosecuted  into  the  ascription  of  improper  and  malicious  actions.”  Imbler  v. \\nPachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 425 (1976).  As the Supreme Court has noted, the existence of civil immunity \\ndoes not justify criminal immunity.  See O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 503 (1974) (“Whatever may be \\n \\nthe case with respect to civil liability generally, . . . we have never held that the performance of the duties \\nof  judicial,  legislative,  or  executive  officers,  requires  or  contemplates  the  immunization  of  otherwise \\ncriminal deprivation of constitutional rights.”) (citations omitted). \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n179 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\nThese considerations distinguish the Supreme Court’s holding in Nixon v. Fitzgerald that, \\nin part because inquiries into the President’s motives would be “highly intrusive,” the President is \\nabsolutely immune from private civil damages actions based on his official conduct.  457 U.S. at \\n756-757.  As Fitzgerald recognized, “there is a lesser public interest in actions for civil damages \\nthan, for example, in criminal prosecutions.”  Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 754 n.37; see Cheney, 542 \\nU.S. at 384.  And private actions are not subject to the institutional protections of an action under \\nthe supervision of the Attorney General and subject to a presumption of regularity.  Armstrong, \\n517 U.S. at 464. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n   \\n\\nc.  In  the  rare  cases  in  which  a  substantial  and  credible  basis  justifies  conducting  an \\ninvestigation of the President, the process of examining his motivations to determine whether he \\nacted  for  a  corrupt  purpose  need  not  have  a  chilling  effect.  Ascertaining  the  President’s \\n \\nmotivations  would  turn  on  any  explanation  he  provided  to  justify  his  actions,  the  advice  he \\nreceived,  the  circumstances  surrounding  the  actions,  and  the  regularity  or  irregularity  of  the \\nprocess he employed to make decisions.  But grand juries and courts would not have automatic \\naccess  to  confidential  presidential  communications  on  those  matters;  rather,  they  could  be \\n \\npresented in official proceedings only on a showing of sufficient need.  Nixon, 418 U.S. at 712; In \\nre Sealed Case, 121 F.3d 729, 754, 756-757 (D.C. Cir. 1997); see also Administrator of General \\nServices, 433 U.S. at 448-449 (former President can invoke presidential communications privilege, \\nalthough successor’s failure to support the claim “detracts from [its] weight”). \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIn  any  event,  probing  the  President’s  intent  in  a  criminal  matter  is  unquestionably \\nconstitutional in at least one context:  the offense of bribery turns on the corrupt intent to receive \\na thing of value in return for being influenced in official action.  18 U.S.C. § 201(b)(2).  There can \\nbe no serious argument against the President’s potential criminal liability for bribery offenses, \\n \\nnotwithstanding the need to ascertain his purpose and intent.  See U.S. CONST. ART. I, § 3; ART. II, \\n§ 4; see also Application of 28 U.S.C. § 458 to Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 \\nOp. O.L.C. at 357 n.11 (“Application of § 201[to the President] raises no separation of powers \\nissue, let alone a serious one.”).     \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nd.  Finally, history provides no reason to believe that any asserted chilling effect justifies \\nexempting the President from the obstruction laws.  As a historical matter, Presidents have very \\n \\nseldom been the subjects of grand jury investigations.  And it is rarer still for circumstances to \\nraise even the possibility of a corrupt personal motive for arguably obstructive action through the \\nPresident’s use of official power.  Accordingly, the President’s conduct of office should not be \\nchilled based on hypothetical concerns about the possible application of a corrupt-motive standard \\nin this context. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n* \\n\\n* \\n\\n* \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIn sum, contrary to the position taken by the President’s counsel, we concluded that, in \\nlight of the Supreme Court precedent governing separation-of-powers issues, we had a valid basis \\nfor investigating the conduct at issue in this report.  In our view, the application of the obstruction \\n \\nstatutes would not impermissibly burden the President’s performance of his Article II function to \\nsupervise  prosecutorial  conduct  or  to  remove  inferior  law-enforcement  officers.  And  the \\nprotection  of  the  criminal  justice  system  from  corrupt  acts  by  any  person—including  the \\nPresident—accords with the fundamental principle of our government that “[n]o [person] in this \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n180 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

CONCLUSION \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\nBecause we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, we did not draw \\nultimate  conclusions  about  the  President’s  conduct.  The  evidence  we  obtained  about  the \\n \\nPresident’s actions and intent presents difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we were \\nmaking  a  traditional  prosecutorial  judgment.  At  the  same  time,  if  we  had  confidence  after  a \\nthorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, \\nwe would so state.  Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach \\nthat judgment.  Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a \\ncrime, it also does not exonerate him.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n182 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed.

If yes,  describe  the  source(s)  of the \\ninformation, when you were informed, and the content of such discussion(s). \\n\\nResponse to Question I, Parts (a) through (c) \\n\\nI  have  no  recollection  of learning at the  time  that  Donald Trump,  Jr., Paul  Manafort,  or Jared \\nKushner was considering participating in a meeting in June 2016 concerning potentially  negative \\ninformation about Hillary  Clinton. Nor do  I recall  learning during the campaign that the June 9, \\n2016 meeting had taken place, that the referenced emails existed, or that Donald J.  Trump, Jr., had \\nother communications with Emin Agalarov or Robert Goldstone between June 3, 20 16  and June \\n9, 2016. \\n\\nResponse to Question I, Part (d) \\n\\nI have no  independent reco llection of what portion  of these four days in  June of 2016 I  spent in \\nTrump Tower.  This was one of many  busy mo nths  during a fast-paced campaign, as  the primary \\nseason was ending and we were preparing for the general election campaign. \\n\\nI am now aware that my Campaign\\'s calendar indicates that I was in New York City from June 6 \\n- 9, 2016. Calendars kept in  my Trump Tower office reflect that I had various calls and meetings \\nscheduled for each of these days.  While those calls  and  meetings may or may not actually have \\ntaken place, they do indicate that  I was in Trump Tower during a portion of each of these working \\ndays,  and  I  have no reason  to doubt that  I  was.  When  I  was  in  New  York C ity,  I  stayed  at  my \\nTrump Tower apartment. \\n\\nMy  Trump  Organization  desk  calendar  also  reflects  that  I  was  outside  Trump  Tower  during \\nportions of these days. The June 7, 2016 calendar indicates I was scheduled to leave Trump Tower \\nin  the  early  evening  for  Westchester where  I  gave  remarks  after  winning  the  California,  New \\nJersey, New Mexico, Montana, and South Dakota Republican primaries held that day. The June 8, \\n2016 calendar indicates a scheduled departure in  late afternoon to attend a ceremony at my  son\\' s \\nschool.  The  June  9,  2016 calendar  indicates  I  was  scheduled  to  attend  midday  meetings  and  a \\nfundraising  luncheon at the Four Seasons Hotel. At this point,  I  do not remember on what dates \\nthese  events  occurred,  but  I  do  not  currently  have  a  reason  to  doubt  that  they  took  place  as \\nscheduled on my calendar. \\n\\nWidely  available  media  reports,  including  television  footage,  also  shed  light  on  my  activities \\nduring  these days.  For example,  I  am aware that my June 7,  2016 victory  remarks  at the Trump \\n\\n8 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)C-13\\x0cNational Golf Club in  Briarcliff Manor, New York, were recorded and published by the media. I \\nremember winning those primaries and generally recall delivering remarks that evening. \\n\\nAt this point in  time,  I do  not remember whether I spoke or met  with  Donald Trump,  Jr., Paul \\nManafort, or Jared  Kushner on June 9, 2016. My desk calendar indicates I was scheduled to meet \\nwith Paul Manafort on the morning of June 9, but I do not recall if that meeting took place. It was \\nmore than two years ago, at a time when I had many calls and interactions daily. \\n\\nResponse to Question I, Part (e) \\n\\nI  have  no  independent  recollection  of any  communications  l  had  with  the  Agalarov  family  or \\nanyone I  understood to be a representative of the Agalarov family after June 3, 2016 and  before \\nthe  end of the campaign. While preparing to respond to these questions, I have become aware of \\nwritten  communications with  the  Agalarovs during  the  campaign  that  were  sent,  received,  and \\nlargely authored by  my staff and which I understand have already been produced to you. \\n\\nIn general, the documents include congratulatory letters on my campaign victories, emails about a \\npainting  Emin  and  Aras  Agalarov  arranged  to  have  delivered  to  Trump  Tower  as  a  birthday \\npresent, and emails regarding delivery ofa book written by Aras Agalarov.  The documents reflect \\nthat the deliveries were screened by the Secret Service. \\n\\nResponse to Question I, Part (t) \\n\\nI do not recall  being aware during the campaign of communications between Donald Trump,  Jr., \\nPaul Manafort, or Jared Kushner and any member or representative ofthe Agalarov family, Robert \\nGoldstone, Natalia Veselnitskaya (whose name 1 was not familiar with), or anyone I  understood \\nto be a Russian official. \\n\\nResponse to Question I, Part (g) \\n\\nIn  remarks  I  delivered the  night I won  the California,  New Jersey, New Mexico,  Montana, and \\nSouth  Dakota  Republican  primaries,  I  said,  \"I  am  going  to  give  a  major  speech  on  probably \\nMonday of next week and we\\'re going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with \\nthe Clintons.\"  In  general, l expected to give a speech referencing the publicly available, negative \\ninformation  about  the  Clintons,  including,  for  example,  Mrs.  Clinton\\' s  failed  policies,  the \\nClintons\\'  use  of the  State Department to  further  their interests  and  the  interests  of the  Clinton \\nFoundation, Mrs.  Clinton\\' s  improper use of a  private server for  State Department business,  the \\ndestruction of33,000 emails on that server, and Mrs. Clinton\\' s temperamental unsuitability for the \\noffice of President. \\n\\nIn the course of preparing to respond to your questions, I have become aware that the Campaign \\ndocuments already produced to you reflect the drafting, evolution, and sources of information for \\nthe  speech  I expected to give \" probably\"  on the Monday following my June 7, 2016 comments. \\nThese documents generally show that the text ofthe speech was initially drafted by Campaign staff \\n\\n9 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)C-14\\x0cwith  input from various outside advisors and was based on publicly available material, including, \\nin particular, information from the book Clinton Cash by Peter Schweizer. \\n\\nThe  Pulse Nightclub terrorist attack took  place  in the early  morning  hours  of Sunday, June  12, \\n2016.  In  light of that tragedy, I gave a speech directed  more specifically to  national  security and \\nterrorism than to the Clintons. That speech was delivered at the Saint Anselm College Institute of \\nPolitics in  Manchester, New Hampshire, and, as reported, opened with the following: \\n\\nThis  was  going  to  be  a  speech  on  Hillary  Clinton  and  how  bad  a  President, \\nespecially  in  these  times  of Radical  Islamic  Terrorism,  she  would  be.  Even  her \\nformer Secret Service Agent, who has seen her under pressure and in times ofstress, \\nhas stated that she  lacks the temperament and  integrity to be president. There will \\nbe plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will \\ndeliver that speech soon. But today there is only one thing to discuss: the growing \\nthreat of terrorism  inside ofour borders. \\n\\nI continued to speak about Mrs. Clinton\\' s failings throughout the campaign, using the information \\nprepared for  inclusion in the speech to which I referred on June 7, 2016. \\n\\nResponse to Question I, Part (h) \\n\\nl  have  no  recollection  of being  told  during  the  campaign  that  Vladimir  Putin  or  the  Russian \\ngovernment \"supported\" my candidacy or \"opposed\" the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.  However, \\nI was aware of some reports  indicating that President Putin  had made complimentary statements \\nabout me. \\n\\nResponse to Question I, Part (i) \\n\\nI have no  recollection of being told during the campaign that any foreign government or foreign \\nleader had provided, wished to provide, or offered to provide tangible support to my campaign. \\n\\nII. \\n\\nRussian  Hacking / Russian Efforts Using Social Media / WikiLeaks \\n\\na. \\n\\nOn  June  14,  2016,  it  was  publicly  reported  that  computer  hackers  had  penetrated  the \\ncomputer  network  of the  Democratic  National  Committee  (DNC)  and  that  Russian \\nintelligence was behind the unauthorized access, or hack.

I do  not recall  being provided any  information during the campaign about the \\nhacking ofany of the named entities or individuals before it became the subject of media reporting. \\n\\n12 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)C-17\\x0cResponse to Question II, Part (b) \\n\\nI recall that in the months leading up to the election there was considerable media reporting about \\nthe possible hacking and release ofcampaign-related information and there was a lot of talk about \\nthis matter. At the time, 1was generally aware ofthese media reports and may have discussed these \\nissues with my campaign staff or others, but at this point in  time - more than two  years  later - 1 \\nhave no recollection ofany particular conversation, when it occurred, or who the participants were. \\n\\nResponse to Question II, Part (c) \\n\\nI do not recall  being aware during the  campaign of any communications between the  individuals \\nnamed  in  Question II  (c) and anyone I understood to be a representative of WikiLeaks or any of \\nthe other individuals or entities referred to in  the question. \\n\\nResponse to Question II, Part (d) \\n\\nl  made the statement quoted  in  Question  II  (d)  in jest and  sarcastically,  as  was apparent to any \\nobjective observer.  The context of the statement is  evident  in  the full  reading or viewing  of the \\nJuly 27, 2016 press conference, and 1 refer you  to the publicly  available transcript and  video of \\nthat press conference. I do not recall having any discussion about the substance of the statement in \\nadvance of the press conference. I do not recall  being told during the campaign of any efforts by \\nRussia  to  infiltrate  or  hack  the  computer  systems  or email  accounts  of Hillary  Clinton  or her \\ncampaign prior to them becoming the subject of media reporting and I have no recollection of any \\nparticular conversation in that regard. \\n\\nResponse to Question II, Part (e) \\n\\nI was in Trump Tower in New York City on October 7, 2016. I have no recollection of being told \\nthat WikiLeaks possessed  or might possess emails related  to John Podesta before the  release  of \\nMr.  Podesta\\' s  emails was reported  by the media. Likewise,  1 have no  recollection of being told \\nthat Roger Stone, anyone acting as an intermediary for Roger Stone, or anyone associated with my \\ncampaign  had communicated with WikiLeaks on  October 7, 2016. \\n\\nResponse to Question II, Part (t) \\n\\nI do not recall  being  told  during  the  campaign  that Roger  Stone or anyone associated  with  my \\ncampaign had discussions with any of the entities named in  the question regarding the content or \\ntiming of release of hacked emails. \\n\\nResponse to Question II, Part (g) \\n\\nI  spoke  by  telephone  with  Roger  Stone  from  time  to  time  during  the  campaign.

What were you told about the project? \\n\\n11. \\n\\nDid you sign the letter of intent? \\n\\nIn a statement provided to Congress, attached as Exhibit C, Michael Cohen stated: \"To the \\nbest of my knowledge, Mr. Trump was never in  contact with anyone about this proposal \\nother than me on three occasions, including signing a non-binding letter of intent in 2015.\" \\nDescribe all discussions you had with Mr. Cohen, or anyone else associated with the Trump \\nOrganization, about the Trump Moscow project, including who you spoke with, when, and \\nthe substance of the discussion(s). \\n\\nDid  you  learn  of any  communications  between  Michael  Cohen  or  Felix  Sater and  any \\nRussian government officials, including officials in the office of Dmitry Peskov, regarding \\nthe Trump Moscow project?

R. Crim. P. 6(e)C-19\\x0cshould cease, or were  you  informed at any  time that the project had  been abandoned? If \\nyes, describe who you spoke with, when, the substance of the discussion(s), and why that \\ndecision was made. \\n\\nf. \\n\\ng. \\n\\nDid you have any discussions regarding what information would be provided publicly or \\nin response to investigative inquiries about potential or actual investments or business deals \\nthe  Trump  Organization  had  in  Russia,  including  the  Trump  Moscow  project?

If yes, describe the business \\ninterests, investments, or arrangements. \\n\\nResponse to Question III, Parts (a) through (g) \\n\\nSometime in 2015, Michael Cohen suggested to me the possibility ofa Trump Organization project \\nin Moscow. As I recall, Mr. Cohen described this as a proposed project ofa general type we have \\ndone in the past in a variety of locations. I signed the non-binding Letter of Intent attached to your \\nquestions as Exhibit B which required no equity or expenditure on our end and was consistent with \\nour ongoing efforts to expand into significant markets around the world. \\n\\nI had few conversations with Mr. Cohen on this subject. As I recall, they were brief, and they were \\nnot memorable. I was not enthused about the proposal, and I do not recall any discussion of travel \\nto  Russia  in  connection  with  it.  I do not remember discussing  it with  anyone else at the Trump \\nOrganization, although it is possible. I do not recall being aware at the time ofany communications \\nbetween Mr.  Cohen or Felix Sater and  any Russian  government official  regarding the Letter of \\nIntent.  In  the  course  of preparing  to  respond  to  your  questions,  I  have  become  aware that  Mr. \\nCohen  sent  an  email  regarding  the  Letter of Intent  to \"Mr.  Peskov\"  at a  general,  public  email \\naccount, which should show there was no meaningful relationship with people in power in Russia. \\nl understand those documents already have been provided to you. \\n\\n[ vaguely  remember press  inquiries and  media reporting during the campaign about whether the \\nTrump Organization  had business dealings in  Russia. I may have spoken with campaign staff or \\nTrump  Organization employees  regarding  responses  to  requests  for  information,  but I  have  no \\ncurrent recollection of any particular conversation, with whom  I  may  have spoken, when, or the \\nsubstance of any conversation. As I recall, neither I nor the Trump Organization had any projects \\nor proposed projects in Russia during the campaign other than the Letter of Intent. \\n\\nIV.

If yes, \\nidentify who provided you with this information, when, the substance of the discussion(s), \\nwhat you  understood  the purpose was of sharing the  internal campaign  information,  and \\nhow you responded to learning this information. \\n\\nDid  Paul  Manafort communicate to you,  directly  or  indirectly,  any  positions Ukraine or \\nRussia  would  want  the  U.S.  to  support?  If yes,  describe  when  he  communicated  those \\npositions to you and the substance of those communications. \\n\\nDuring the campaign, were you told about efforts by  Russian officials  to meet with you or \\nsenior members of your campaign?

Prior to the convention, what \\ninformation did you have about this platform provision? After the platform provision was \\nchanged, who told you about the change, when did they tell you, what were you told about \\nwhy it was changed, and who was involved? \\n\\nOn July 27, 2016, in response to a question about whether you would recognize Crimea as \\nRussian  territory and  lift  sanctions on Russia,  you said:  \" We\\'ll  be looking at that.  Yeah, \\nwe\\'ll be  looking.\"  Did you  intend to communicate by that statement or at any other time \\nduring the campaign a  willingness to lift sanctions and/or recognize Russia\\'s annexation \\nof Crimea if you were elected? \\n\\ni. \\n\\nWhat consideration  did  you  give to  lifting sanctions and/or recognizing  Russia\\'s \\nannexation of Crimea if you were elected? Describe who you spoke with about this \\ntopic, when, the substance of the discussion(s). \\n\\nResponse to Question IV, Parts (a) through (d) \\n\\nMr.  Manafort was hired primarily  because of his delegate work for prior presidential candidates, \\nincluding  Gerald  Ford,  Ronald  Reagan,  George  H.W.  Bush,  and  Bob  Dole.  I  knew  that  Mr. \\nManafort had done international consulting work and,  at some time  before Mr.  Manafort left the \\n\\n16 \\n\\nU.S. Department of Justice Attorney Work Product // May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)C-21\\x0ccampaign, I learned that he was somehow involved with individuals concerning Ukraine, but I do \\nnot remember the specifics of what I knew at the time. \\n\\nI  had  no  knowledge  of Mr.  Manafort  offering  briefings  on  the  progress  of my  campaign to  an \\nindividual  named Oleg Deripaska, nor do I remember being aware of Mr.  Manafort or anyone else \\nassociated  with  my  campaign  sending  or  directing  others  to  send  internal  Trump  Campaign \\ninformation to  anyone I knew to  be  in  Ukraine or Russia at the time or to anyone I understood to \\nbe  a  Ukrainian  or  Russian  government  employee  or  official. I  do  not  remember  Mr.  Manafort \\ncommunicating to  me any particular positions Ukraine or Russia would want the United States to \\nsupport. \\n\\nResponse to Question IV, Part (e) \\n\\nI do  not recall  being told  during the campaign of efforts by  Russian officials to  meet with me or \\nwith senior members of my campaign. In the process of preparing to respond to these questions, I \\nbecame  aware  that  on  March  17,  2016,  my  assistant  at  the  Trump  Organization, Rhona  Graff, \\nreceived  an  email  from  a  Sergei Prikhodko, who  identified  himself as  Deputy Prime Minister of \\nthe Russian  Federation, Foundation  Roscongress,  inviting me to  participate in  the  St.  Petersburg \\nInternational  Economic  Forum  to  be  held  in  June  2016.  The  documents  show  that  Ms.  Graff \\nprepared for my signature a brief response declining the  invitation. I understand these documents \\nalready have been produced to you. \\n\\nResponse to Question IV, Part (t) \\n\\nI have  no  recollection  of the  details of what, when,  or from  what source l first  learned about the \\nchange to the platform amendment regarding arming Ukraine, but I generally recall learning of the \\nissue  as  part of media reporting.  I  do  not recall  being  involved  in  changing the  language to  the \\namendment. \\n\\nResponse to Question IV, Part (g) \\n\\nMy statement did not communicate any position. \\n\\nV. \\n\\na. \\n\\nContacts with Russia and Russia-Related Issues During the Transition \\n\\nWere you asked to attend the World Chess Championship gala on November 10, 2016?

Transfers \\n \\nThe Special Counsel’s Office has concluded its investigation into links and coordination \\nbetween the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign.  Certain \\n \\n \\nmatters assigned to the Office by the Acting Attorney General have not fully concluded as of the \\n \\ndate of this report.  After consultation with the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Office \\nhas transferred responsibility for those matters to other components of the Department of Justice \\n \\nand the FBI.  Those transfers include: \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n1.  United States v. Bijan Rafiekian and Kamil Ekim Alptekin \\n \\nU.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia \\n \\n(Awaiting trial) \\n \\n \\nThe Acting Attorney General authorized the Special Counsel to investigate, among other \\n \\nthings,  possible  criminal  conduct  by  Michael  Flynn  in  acting  as  an  unregistered  agent  for  the \\n \\nGovernment of Turkey.  See August 2, 2017 Memorandum from Rod J. Rosenstein to Robert S. \\nMueller,  III.  The Acting Attorney General later confirmed the Special Counsel’s authority to \\n \\ninvestigate Rafiekian and Alptekin because they “may have been jointly involved” with Flynn in \\n \\nFARA-related  crimes.  See  October  20,  2017  Memorandum  from  Associate  Deputy  Attorney \\nGeneral Scott Schools to Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein.   \\n\\n   \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nOn December 1, 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to an Information charging him with making \\nfalse statements to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States. \\n \\n \\nAs part of that plea, Flynn agreed to a Statement of the Offense in which he acknowledged that \\nthe Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) documents he filed on March 7, 2017 “contained \\nmaterially false statements and omissions.”  Flynn’s plea occurred before the Special Counsel had \\n \\n \\nmade a final decision on whether to charge Rafiekian or Alptekin.  On March 27, 2018, after \\n \\nconsultation with the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Special Counsel’s Office referred \\nthe investigation of Rafiekian and Alptekin to the National Security Division (NSD) for any action \\n \\nit  deemed  appropriate.  The  Special  Counsel’s  Office  determined  the  referral  was  appropriate \\n \\nbecause the investigation of Flynn had been completed, and that investigation had provided the \\nrationale for the Office’s investigation of Rafiekian and Alptekin.  At NSD’s request, the Eastern \\n \\nDistrict of Virginia continued the investigation of Rafiekian and Alptekin. \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n   \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n2.

       " ' \\n\\nThis report is submitted to the Attorney General pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 600.8(c), which \\nstates that, “[a]t the conclusion of the Special Counsel’s work, he . . . shall provide the Attorney \\nGeneral  a  confidential  report  explaining  the  prosecution  or  declination  decisions  [the  Special \\nCounsel] reached.” \\n \\n\\nThe  Russian  government  interfered  in  the  2016  presidential  election  in  sweeping  and \\nsystematic fashion.  Evidence of Russian government operations began to surface in mid-2016.  In \\nJune, the Democratic National Committee and its cyber response team publicly announced that \\nRussian hackers had compromised its computer network.  Releases of hacked materials—hacks \\nthat  public  reporting  soon  attributed  to  the  Russian  government—began  that  same  month. \\nAdditional releases followed in July through the organization WikiLeaks, with further releases in \\n \\nOctober and November.     ',\n",
       " ' ',\n",
       " ' \\n\\n \\nIn  late  July  2016,  soon  after  WikiLeaks’s  first  release  of  stolen  documents,  a  foreign \\ngovernment contacted the FBI about a May 2016 encounter with Trump Campaign foreign policy \\nadvisor George Papadopoulos.  Papadopoulos had suggested to a representative of that foreign \\ngovernment that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that \\nit  could  assist  the  Campaign  through  the  anonymous  release  of  information  damaging  to \\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.  That information prompted the FBI on July \\n31, 2016, to open an investigation into whether individuals associated with the Trump Campaign \\nwere coordinating with the Russian government in its interference activities. \\n\\n \\nThat fall, two federal agencies jointly announced that the Russian government “directed \\nrecent  compromises  of  e-mails  from  US  persons  and  institutions,  including  US  political \\norganizations,” and, “[t]hese thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election \\n \\nprocess.” After the election, in late December 2016, the United States imposed sanctions on Russia \\nfor  having  interfered  in  the  election.  By  early  2017,  several  congressional  committees  were \\nexamining Russia’s interference in the election.    \\n\\n \\nWithin the Executive Branch, these investigatory efforts ultimately led to the May 2017 \\nappointment of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III.  The order appointing the Special Counsel \\nauthorized  him  to  investigate  “the  Russian  government’s  efforts  to  interfere  in  the  2016 \\npresidential election,” including any links or coordination between the Russian government and \\nindividuals associated with the Trump Campaign.   \\n\\n \\nAs set forth in detail in this report, the Special Counsel’s investigation established that \\nRussia interfered in the 2016 presidential election principally through two operations.  First, a \\nRussian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. \\nTrump  and  disparaged  presidential  candidate  Hillary  Clinton.  Second,  a  Russian  intelligence \\nservice  conducted  computer-intrusion  operations  against  entities,  employees,  and  volunteers \\n \\nworking on the Clinton Campaign and then released stolen documents.  The investigation also \\nidentified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump Campaign.  Although \\nthe investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump \\npresidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n ',\n",

In some instances, the report points out \\nthe absence of evidence or conflicts in the evidence about a particular fact or event.  In other \\n \\ninstances,  when  substantial,  credible  evidence  enabled  the  Office  to  reach  a  conclusion  with \\n \\nconfidence,  the  report  states  that  the  investigation  established  that  certain  actions  or  events \\n \\noccurred.  A statement that the investigation did not establish particular facts does not mean there \\nwas no evidence of those facts. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nIn evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted \\na crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of “collusion.”  In so doing, \\nthe  Office  recognized  that  the  word  “collud[e]”  was  used  in  communications  with  the  Acting \\n \\nAttorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation’s scope and that the term has \\nfrequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation.  But collusion is not a specific \\noffense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal \\ncriminal law.  For those reasons, the Office’s focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability \\n \\nwas on conspiracy as defined in federal law.  In connection with that analysis, we addressed the \\nfactual question whether members of the Trump Campaign “coordinat[ed]”—a term that appears \\nin  the  appointment  order—with  Russian  election  interference  activities.  Like  collusion, \\n \\n“coordination”  does  not  have  a  settled  definition  in  federal  criminal  law.  We  understood \\ncoordination to require an agreement—tacit or express—between the Trump Campaign and the \\nRussian  government  on  election  interference.   That  requires  more  than  the  two  parties  taking \\n \\nactions that were informed by or responsive to the other’s actions or interests.  We applied the term \\ncoordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the \\nTrump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. \\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n ',\n",

To organize those rallies, IRA employees posed as U.S. grassroots entities and persons and \\nmade contact with Trump supporters and Trump Campaign officials in the United States.  The \\ninvestigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons conspired or coordinated with the \\nIRA.  Section  II  of  this  report  details  the  Office’s  investigation  of  the  Russian  social  media \\n \\ncampaign.   \\n\\n \\nRUSSIAN HACKING OPERATIONS   \\n \\n \\nAt the same time that the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Trump in \\nearly 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference:  cyber intrusions \\n(hacking)  and  releases  of  hacked  materials  damaging  to  the  Clinton  Campaign.  The  Russian \\nintelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian \\n \\nArmy (GRU) carried out these operations.   \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n  ',\n",

The GRU stole hundreds of thousands \\nof documents from the compromised email accounts and networks.  Around the time that the DNC \\nannounced in  mid-June 2016  the  Russian  government’s  role  in  hacking  its  network,  the  GRU \\nbegan  disseminating  stolen  materials  through  the  fictitious  online  personas  “DCLeaks”  and \\n“Guccifer 2.0.”  The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.

Beginning in June 2016, \\n forecast to \\nsenior  Campaign  officials  that  WikiLeaks  would  release  information  damaging  to  candidate \\nClinton.  WikiLeaks’s first release came  in July 2016.  Around the  same time, candidate Trump  \\nannounced that he hoped Russia would recover emails described as missing from  a  private server \\nused by Clinton when she was Secretary of State (he later said that he was speaking sarcastically). \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\nWikiLeaks  began  releasing \\nPodesta’s stolen emails on October 7, 2016, less than one hour after a U.S. media outlet released \\nvideo considered damaging to candidate Trump.

Although  the  investigation \\nestablished that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and \\nworked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from \\ninformation stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that \\nmembers of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its \\nelection interference activities. \\n\\n   ',\n",

One  week  later,  in  the  first  week  of  May  2016,  Papadopoulos  suggested  to  a \\nrepresentative of a foreign government that the Trump Campaign had received indications from \\nthe  Russian  government  that  it  could  assist  the  Campaign  through  the  anonymous  release  of \\ninformation damaging to candidate Clinton.  Throughout that period of time and for several months \\n \\nthereafter, Papadopoulos worked with Mifsud and two Russian nationals to arrange a meeting \\nbetween the Campaign and the Russian government.  No meeting took place. \\n \\n\\nSummer 2016.  Russian outreach to the Trump Campaign continued into the summer of \\n2016, as candidate Trump was becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for President.  On \\nJune 9, 2016, for example, a Russian lawyer met with senior Trump Campaign officials Donald \\nTrump  Jr.,  Jared  Kushner,  and  campaign  chairman  Paul  Manafort  to  deliver  what  the  email \\nproposing  the  meeting  had  described  as  “official  documents  and  information  that  would \\nincriminate  Hillary.”  The  materials  were  offered  to  Trump  Jr.  as  “part  of  Russia  and  its \\ngovernment’s  support  for  Mr.  Trump.”  The  written  communications  setting  up  the  meeting \\nshowed  that  the  Campaign  anticipated  receiving  information  from  Russia  that  could  assist \\ncandidate Trump’s electoral prospects, but the Russian lawyer’s presentation did not provide such \\ninformation.  \\n\\n \\nDays  after  the  June  9  meeting,  on  June  14,  2016,  a  cybersecurity  firm  and  the  DNC \\n \\nannounced  that  Russian  government  hackers  had  infiltrated  the  DNC  and  obtained  access  to \\n  \\nopposition research on candidate Trump, among other documents. \\n ',\n",

Page had lived and worked \\nin Russia between 2003 and 2007.  After returning to the United States, Page became acquainted \\nwith  at  least  two  Russian  intelligence  officers,  one  of  whom  was  later  charged  in  2015  with \\nconspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of Russia.  Page’s July 2016 trip to Moscow and his \\n \\nadvocacy for pro-Russian foreign policy drew media attention. The Campaign then distanced itself \\nfrom Page and, by late September 2016, removed him from the Campaign.  \\n\\n \\nJuly 2016 was also the month WikiLeaks first released emails stolen by the GRU from the \\n \\nDNC.  On  July  22,  2016,  WikiLeaks  posted  thousands  of  internal  DNC  documents  revealing \\n \\ninformation  about  the  Clinton  Campaign.  Within  days,  there  was  public  reporting  that  U.S. \\nintelligence agencies had “high confidence” that the Russian government was behind the theft of \\nemails and documents from the DNC.

On October 7, 2016, the media released video of candidate Trump speaking in \\n \\ngraphic terms about women years earlier, which was considered damaging to his candidacy.  Less \\nthan an hour later, WikiLeaks made its second release:  thousands of John Podesta’s emails that \\nhad been stolen by the GRU in late March 2016.  The FBI and other U.S. government institutions \\nwere at the time continuing their investigation of suspected Russian government efforts to interfere \\nin the presidential election.  That same day, October 7, the Department of Homeland Security and \\nthe Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a joint public statement “that the Russian \\nGovernment  directed  the  recent  compromises  of  e-mails  from  US  persons  and  institutions, \\nincluding from US political organizations.”  Those “thefts” and the “disclosures” of the hacked \\nmaterials through online platforms such as WikiLeaks, the statement continued, “are intended to \\ninterfere with the US election process.” \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n  \\nPost-2016  Election.  Immediately  after  the  November  8  election,  Russian  government \\n \\nofficials  and  prominent  Russian  businessmen  began  trying  to  make  inroads  into  the  new \\nadministration.

Many of the individuals and entities involved in the social media \\ncampaign have been charged with participating in a conspiracy to defraud the United States by \\n \\nundermining through deceptive acts the work of federal agencies charged with regulating foreign \\ninfluence in U.S. elections, as well as related counts of identity theft.

Among other things, the evidence was not sufficient to \\ncharge any Campaign official as an unregistered agent of the Russian government or other Russian \\n \\nprincipal.  And our evidence about the June 9, 2016 meeting and WikiLeaks’s releases of hacked \\nmaterials was not sufficient to charge a criminal campaign-finance violation.  Further, the evidence \\nwas  not  sufficient  to  charge  that  any  member  of  the  Trump  Campaign  conspired  with \\nrepresentatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.  \\n\\n \\nThird,  the  investigation  established  that  several  individuals  affiliated  with  the  Trump \\nCampaign  lied  to  the  Office,  and  to  Congress,  about  their  interactions  with  Russian-affiliated \\n \\nindividuals  and  related  matters.  Those  lies  materially  impaired  the  investigation  of  Russian \\nelection interference.  The Office charged some of those lies as violations of the federal false-\\nstatements statute.

The \\n \\ninvestigation also did not establish that a meeting between Kislyak and Sessions in September \\n2016 at Sessions’s Senate office included any more than a passing mention of the presidential \\ncampaign.  \\n\\n \\nThe investigation did not always yield admissible information or testimony, or a complete \\npicture of the activities undertaken by subjects of the investigation.  Some individuals invoked \\ntheir Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination and were not, in the Office’s \\n \\njudgment, appropriate candidates for grants of immunity.  The Office limited its pursuit of other \\n \\nwitnesses and information—such as information known to attorneys or individuals claiming to be \\nmembers  of  the  media—in  light  of  internal  Department  of  Justice  policies.  See,  e.g.,  Justice \\nManual §§ 9-13.400, 13.410.  Some of the information obtained via court process, moreover, was \\npresumptively  covered  by  legal  privilege  and  was  screened  from  investigators  by  a  filter  (or \\n“taint”)  team.  Even  when  individuals  testified  or  agreed  to  be  interviewed,  they  sometimes \\nprovided information that was false or incomplete, leading to some of the false-statements charges \\ndescribed above.  And the Office faced practical limits on its ability to access relevant evidence as \\nwell—numerous witnesses and subjects lived abroad, and documents were held outside the United \\nStates. \\n\\n \\n \\nFurther, the Office learned that some of the individuals we interviewed or whose conduct \\nwe  investigated—including  some  associated  with  the  Trump  Campaign—deleted  relevant \\ncommunications  or  communicated  during  the  relevant  period  using  applications  that  feature \\n \\nencryption or that do not provide for long-term retention of data or communications records.  In \\n \\nsuch  cases,  the  Office  was  not  able  to  corroborate  witness  statements  through  comparison  to \\ncontemporaneous  communications  or  fully  question  witnesses  about  statements  that  appeared \\ninconsistent with other known facts. \\n\\n \\nAccordingly, while this report embodies factual and legal determinations that the Office \\nbelieves to be accurate and complete to the greatest extent possible, given these identified gaps, \\nthe Office cannot rule out the possibility that the unavailable information would shed additional \\nlight on (or cast in a new light) the events described in the report.   \\n   ',\n",

       " 'On May 17, 2017, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein—then serving as Acting \\nAttorney General for the Russia investigation following the recusal of former Attorney General \\n \\nJeff  Sessions  on  March  2,  2016—appointed  the  Special  Counsel  “to  investigate  Russian \\ninterference with the 2016 presidential election and related matters.”  Office of the Deputy Att’y \\nGen., Order No. 3915-2017, Appointment of Special Counsel to Investigate Russian Interference \\nwith the 2016 Presidential Election and Related Matters, May 17, 2017) (“Appointment Order”).  \\nRelying on “the authority vested” in the Acting Attorney General, “including 28 U.S.C. §§ 509, \\n510, and 515,” the Acting Attorney General ordered the appointment of a Special Counsel “in \\norder  to  discharge  [the  Acting  Attorney  General’s]  responsibility  to  provide  supervision  and \\nmanagement of the Department of Justice, and to ensure a full and thorough investigation of the \\nRussian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.”  Appointment Order \\n(introduction). “The Special Counsel,” the Order stated, “is authorized to conduct the investigation \\nconfirmed by then-FBI Director James B. Comey in testimony before the House Permanent Select \\nCommittee on Intelligence on March 20, 2017,” including: \\n ',\n",

Section 600.4 affords the Special Counsel “the authority to investigate \\nand prosecute federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the \\n \\nSpecial Counsel’s investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, \\nand intimidation of witnesses.”  28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a).  The authority to investigate “any matters \\nthat arose . . . directly from the investigation,” Appointment Order ¶ (b)(ii), covers similar crimes \\nthat may have occurred during the course of the FBI’s confirmed investigation before the Special \\nCounsel’s appointment.  “If the Special Counsel believes it is necessary and appropriate,” the \\n \\nOrder further provided, “the Special Counsel is authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from \\nthe investigation of these matters.”  Id. ¶ (c).  Finally, the Acting Attorney General made applicable \\n“Sections 600.4 through 600.10 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations.”  Id. ¶ (d). \\n\\n \\nThe  Acting  Attorney  General  further  clarified  the  scope  of  the  Special  Counsel’s \\ninvestigatory authority in two subsequent memoranda.  A memorandum dated August 2, 2017, \\nexplained that the Appointment Order had been “worded categorically in order to permit its public \\n \\nrelease  without  confirming  specific  investigations  involving  specific  individuals.” \\nIt  then \\n \\nconfirmed  that  the  Special  Counsel  had  been  authorized  since  his  appointment  to  investigate \\n \\nallegations  that  three  Trump  campaign  officials—Carter  Page,  Paul  Manafort,  and  George \\n \\nPapadopoulos—“committed a crime or crimes by colluding with Russian government officials \\n \\nwith respect to the Russian government’s efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.”  \\nThe  memorandum  also  confirmed  the  Special  Counsel’s  authority  to  investigate  certain  other \\nmatters,  including  two  additional  sets  of  allegations  involving  Manafort  (crimes  arising  from \\npayments he received from the Ukrainian government and crimes arising from his receipt of loans \\n \\n\\n   \\n\\n  ',\n",

First, “as part of a \\nfull  and  thorough  investigation  of  the  Russian  government’s  efforts  to  interfere  in  the  2016 \\npresidential election,” the Special Counsel was authorized to investigate “the pertinent activities \\nof Michael Cohen, Richard Gates,  \\n \\n”    “Confirmation  of  the  authorization  to  investigate  such  individuals,”  the  memorandum \\nstressed, “does not suggest that the Special Counsel has made a  determination that  any  of  them  has \\ncommitted a crime.”  Second, with respect to Michael Cohen,  the  memorandum  recognized the \\nSpecial Counsel’s authority to investigate “leads relate[d] to Cohen’s establishment and use of \\nEssential Consultants LLC to, inter alia, receive funds from  Russian-backed entities.”  Third, the \\nmemorandum  memorialized the Special Counsel’s authority to investigate individuals and entities \\nwho  were  possibly  engaged  in  “jointly  undertaken  activity”  with   existing  subjects  of  the \\ninvestigation, including Paul Manafort.  Finally, the memorandum  described an FBI investigation  \\nopened before the Special Counsel’s appointment into “allegations that [then-Attorney General  \\nJeff Sessions] made false statements to the United States Senate[,]” and confirmed the Special  \\nCounsel’s authority to investigate that matter.    \\n\\n, Roger Stone, and\\n\\nPP \\n\\n \\nThe Special Counsel structured the investigation in view of his power and authority “to \\nexercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions of any United States Attorney.”  28 C.F.R. \\n§ 600.6.  Like  a  U.S.  Attorney’s  Office,  the  Special  Counsel’s  Office  considered  a  range  of \\n \\nclassified and unclassified information available to the FBI in the course of the Office’s Russia \\ninvestigation, and the Office structured that work around evidence for possible use in prosecutions \\nof federal crimes (assuming that one or more crimes were identified that warranted prosecution).  \\nThere was substantial evidence immediately available to the Special Counsel at the inception of \\nthe investigation in May 2017 because the FBI had, by that time, already investigated Russian \\nelection interference for nearly 10 months.  The Special Counsel’s Office exercised its judgment \\nregarding what to investigate and did not, for instance, investigate every public report of a contact \\nbetween the Trump Campaign and Russian-affiliated individuals and entities.      \\n\\n \\nThe Office has concluded its investigation into links and coordination between the Russian \\n \\ngovernment and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign.  Certain proceedings associated \\nwith the Office’s work remain ongoing.  After consultation with the Office of the Deputy Attorney \\nGeneral, the Office has transferred responsibility for those remaining issues to other components \\nof the Department of Justice and FBI.  Appendix D lists those transfers.   \\n\\n \\nTwo district courts confirmed the breadth of the Special Counsel’s authority to investigate \\nRussia election interference and links and/or coordination with the Trump Campaign.

Over time, these \\nsocial media accounts became a means to reach large U.S. audiences.

The third phase consisted of checking with \\n \\ncertain intelligence sources “that have access through liaison work with various foreign services” \\n \\nto determine if any of those services had gotten to the server.

In approximately September 2015, Felix Sater, a New York-\\nbased real estate advisor, contacted Michael Cohen, then-executive vice president of the Trump \\nOrganization and special counsel to Donald J. Trump.304  Sater had previously worked with the \\n \\n \\nTrump Organization and advised it on a number of domestic and international projects.  Sater had \\nexplored the possibility of a Trump Tower project in Moscow while working with the Trump \\n \\nOrganization  and  therefore  knew  of  the  organization’s  general  interest  in  completing  a  deal \\nthere.305    Sater  had  also  served  as  an  informal  agent  of  the  Trump  Organization  in  Moscow \\npreviously and had accompanied Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. to Moscow in the mid-\\n \\n2000s.306 \\n \\n \\nSater  contacted  Cohen  on  behalf  of  I.C.  Expert  Investment  Company  (I.C.  Expert),  a \\n \\nRussian real-estate development corporation controlled by Andrei Vladimirovich Rozov.307  Sater \\n \\nhad known Rozov since approximately 2007 and, in 2014, had served as an agent on behalf of \\nRozov during Rozov’s purchase of a building in New York City.308  Sater later contacted Rozov \\nand proposed that I.C. Expert pursue a Trump Tower Moscow project in which I.C. Expert would \\nlicense the name and brand from the Trump Organization but construct the building on its own. \\n   \\nSater worked on the deal with Rozov and another employee of I.C. Expert.309 \\n\\n \\nCohen  was  the  only  Trump  Organization  representative  to  negotiate  directly  with  I.C. \\nExpert or its agents.  In approximately September 2015, Cohen obtained approval to negotiate with \\n \\nI.C. Expert from candidate Trump, who was then president of the Trump Organization.  Cohen \\nprovided updates directly to Trump about the project throughout 2015 and into 2016, assuring him \\nthe  project  was  continuing.310  Cohen  also  discussed  the  Trump  Moscow  project  with  Ivanka \\nTrump as to design elements (such as possible architects to use for the project311) and Donald J. \\nTrump Jr. (about his experience in Moscow and possible involvement in the project312) during the \\nfall of 2015. \\n\\n   \\n\\n  ',\n",

The Office was \\nnot fully able to explore the contact because the individual at issue—Sergei Millian—remained \\nout of the country since the inception of our investigation and declined to meet with members of \\n  \\nthe Office despite our repeated efforts to obtain an interview. \\n\\n  \\n \\nPapadopoulos first connected with Millian via LinkedIn on July 15, 2016, shortly after \\n \\nPapadopoulos had attended the TAG Summit with Clovis.500  Millian, an American citizen who is \\na native of Belarus, introduced himself “as president of [the] New York-based Russian American \\nChamber of Commerce,” and claimed that through that position he had “insider knowledge and \\ndirect access to the top hierarchy in Russian politics.”501  Papadopoulos asked Timofeev whether \\nhe had heard of Millian.502  Although Timofeev said no,503 Papadopoulos met Millian in New York \\n \\nCity.504  The meetings took place on July 30 and August 1, 2016.505  Afterwards, Millian invited \\n \\nPapadopoulos  to  attend—and  potentially  speak  at—two  international  energy  conferences, \\nincluding one that was to be held in Moscow in September 2016.506  Papadopoulos ultimately did \\nnot attend either conference. \\n \\n\\nOn  July  31,  2016,  following  his  first  in-person  meeting  with  Millian,  Papadopoulos \\nemailed Trump Campaign official Bo Denysyk to say that he had been contacted “by some leaders \\nof Russian-American voters here in the US about their interest in voting for Mr. Trump,” and to \\n  \\nask whether he should “put you in touch with their group (US-Russia chamber of commerce).”507 \\nDenysyk  thanked  Papadopoulos  “for  taking  the  initiative,”  but  asked  him  to  “hold  off  with \\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  ',\n",

The meeting was proposed to Donald Trump Jr. in an email from Robert \\nGoldstone, at the request of his then-client Emin Agalarov, the son of Russian real-estate developer \\nAras Agalarov.  Goldstone relayed to Trump Jr. that the “Crown prosecutor of Russia . . . offered \\n \\nto  provide  the  Trump  Campaign  with  some  official  documents  and  information  that  would \\n \\nincriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia” as “part of Russia and its government’s support \\nfor Mr. Trump.”  Trump Jr. immediately responded that “if it’s what you say I love it,” and arranged \\nthe meeting through a series of emails and telephone calls.  \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\nTrump Jr. invited campaign chairman Paul Manafort and senior advisor Jared Kushner to \\nattend the meeting, and both attended.  Members of the Campaign discussed the meeting before it \\noccurred, and Michael Cohen recalled that Trump Jr. may have told candidate Trump about an \\nupcoming meeting to receive adverse information about Clinton, without linking the meeting to \\nRussia.  According to written answers submitted by President Trump, he has no recollection of \\nlearning of the meeting at the time, and the Office found no documentary evidence showing that he \\nwas made aware of the meeting—or its Russian connection—before it occurred. \\n \\n\\nThe  Russian  attorney  who  spoke  at  the  meeting,  Natalia  Veselnitskaya,  had  previously \\n \\nworked for the Russian government and maintained a relationship with that government throughout \\nthis period of time.  She claimed that funds derived from illegal activities in Russia were provided \\n \\nto Hillary Clinton and other Democrats.  Trump Jr. requested evidence to support those claims, but \\nVeselnitskaya did not provide such information.  She and her associates then turned to a critique of \\n \\nthe origins of the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 statute that imposed financial and travel sanctions on \\nRussian officials and that resulted in a retaliatory ban on adoptions of Russian children. Trump Jr. \\n \\nsuggested that the issue could be revisited when and if candidate Trump was elected.  After the \\nelection,  Veselnitskaya  made  additional  efforts  to  follow  up  on  the  meeting,  but  the  Trump \\nTransition Team did not engage.         \\n ',\n",

Trump (Nov. 20, 2018), at 8 (Response to Question I, Parts (a)-\\n(c)).  We considered whether one sequence of events suggested that candidate Trump had contemporaneous \\n \\nknowledge of the June 9 meeting.  On June 7, 2016 Trump announced his intention to give “a major speech” \\n“probably Monday of next week”—which would have been June 13—about “all of the things that have \\ntaken place with the Clintons.”  See, e.g., Phillip Bump, What we know about the Trump Tower meeting, \\nWashington Post (Aug. 7, 2018).  Following the June 9 meeting, Trump changed the subject of his planned \\n \\nspeech to national security.  But the Office did not find evidence that the original idea for the speech was \\nconnected to the anticipated June 9 meeting or that the change of topic was attributable to the failure of that \\nmeeting to produce concrete evidence about Clinton.  Other events, such as the Pulse nightclub shooting \\n \\non June 12, could well have caused the change.  The President’s written answers to our questions state that \\nthe speech’s focus was altered “[i]n light of” the Pulse nightclub shooting.  See Written Responses, supra. \\n \\nAs for the original topic of the June 13 speech, Trump has said that “he expected to give a speech referencing \\n \\nthe publicly available, negative information about the Clintons,” and that the draft of the speech prepared \\nby Campaign staff “was based on publicly available material, including, in particular, information from the \\nbook Clinton Cash by Peter Schweizer.”  Written Responses, supra.  In a later June 22 speech, Trump did \\n \\nspeak extensively about allegations that Clinton was corrupt, drawing from the Clinton Cash book.

In a July 2017 press interview, Veselnitskaya claimed that she has no connection \\nto the Russian government and had not referred to any derogatory information concerning the \\nClinton Campaign when she met with Trump Campaign officials.737  Veselnitskaya’s November \\n \\n2017 written submission to the Senate Judiciary Committee stated that the purpose of the June 9 \\n \\nmeeting was not to connect with “the Trump Campaign” but rather to have “a private meeting with \\nDonald Trump Jr.—a friend of my good acquaintance’s son on the matter of assisting me or my \\ncolleagues  in  informing  the  Congress  members  as  to  the  criminal  nature  of  manipulation  and \\ninterference with the legislative activities of the US Congress.”738  In other words, Veselnitskaya \\n \\nclaimed her focus was on Congress and not the Campaign.  No witness, however, recalled any \\nreference to Congress during the meeting.  Veselnitskaya also maintained that she “attended the \\n \\nmeeting as a lawyer of Denis Katsyv,” the previously mentioned owner of Prevezon Holdings, but \\n   \\nshe did not “introduce [her]self in this capacity.”739 \\n \\n\\nIn a July 2017 television interview, Trump Jr. stated that while he had no way to gauge the \\nreliability, credibility, or accuracy of what Goldstone had stated was the purpose of the meeting, \\nif “someone has information on our opponent . . . maybe this is something.  I should hear them \\nout.”740  Trump Jr. further stated in September 2017 congressional testimony that he thought he \\nshould  “listen  to  what  Rob  and  his  colleagues  had  to  say.”741  Depending  on  what,  if  any, \\ninformation  was  provided,  Trump  Jr.  stated  he  could  then  “consult  with  counsel  to  make  an \\ninformed decision as to whether to give it any further consideration.”742 \\n \\n \\n\\n     \\n\\n   \\n\\n   \\n\\n   \\n\\n  ',\n",
