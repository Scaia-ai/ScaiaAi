David:
Do you have a simulation set up that will allow me to simulate trades by
pushing a buy or sell button and will move the two way so i can try
simulating actual market cicumstances?

John,

You might recall we spoke a few weeks ago about a system with more
intelligence for out-of-hours trading than just leaving the products on Last
Trade is Mid.

Attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work. It builds on
Offset to Last Trade functionality.

The simplified description is: It tracks two variables: Intensity(Speed) and
Bias (Buy or Sell emphasis).  As Intensity increases, the Spread increases.
