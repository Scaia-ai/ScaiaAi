Tesla has announced that version 10 of its in-car software has begun rolling out to Model S, Model X, and Model 3 owners. Those who paid for the Full Self-Driving option on their car are higher up on the priority list, with a wider release coming in “about a week” containing “slight improvements” from this build, according to Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Tesla says this is its largest software update ever to this point and highlights all the improvements as a key advantage of buying one of the company’s cars.

Software Version 10.0 — you’d think Musk would’ve branded it by now — includes a lot of new entertainment options for Tesla drivers. Spotify Premium, Netflix, YouTube, and Hulu (including with live TV) are now available. The video services can only be viewed when a vehicle is parked, but Spotify integration has been a huge request among Tesla’s customers, the company says, and that obviously works all the time. Also, people who stream their music over Bluetooth will appreciate that album art now shows up on the Tesla display.
