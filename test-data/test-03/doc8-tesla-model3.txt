Tesla often touts that its cars are really safe, but the company has just received a specific recognition of that safety for the first time ever: the Model 3 was just awarded “top safety pick +” from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). The Model S had previously fallen short of earning top marks from IIHS, and the Model X was never tested by the nonprofit group,

The Model 3 is the second battery electric car to earn the award, as Audi’s E-Tron was the first to earn the honor back in August. Like the E-Tron, the Model 3 earned “good” ratings in all categories, which is the best distinction the IIHS gives out. The Model 3 was only really dinged in two places. IIHS said that pre-June 2018 versions of the car only had “acceptable” headlights. And on all models, the group said there’s a “moderate risk of injury to the left lower leg” of the driver in head-on crashes that overlap with the driver’s side of the vehicle (which IIHS says is one of the most challenging tests).
