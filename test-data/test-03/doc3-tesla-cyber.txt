At the Tesla Cybertruck event in Los Angeles on Thursday, Elon Musk said three words most of the tech world is familiar with: “One more thing.” That turned out to be an electric all-terrain vehicle. The ATV can charge from the bed of the Cybertruck, naturally.

The Tesla ATV’s aesthetic is still very much in the Blade Runner motif that Musk touted in the run-up to the event. We’ll have more details about the ATV as we get them from Tesla, so stay tuned.
