Two days after its big (and slightly botched) unveiling, the Cybertruck is already racking up a lot of interest. Tesla had received 146,000 deposits for the electric pickup truck as of Saturday, later increasing to 200,000, Elon Musk tweeted on Sunday. That’s a cool $20 million for Tesla’s bank account in just 48 hours. (Musk is calling these deposits pre-orders, though customers are not required to put down more than a trivial amount for the car, and are under no commitment to actually order it.)

Tesla is offering three versions of the truck: single motor rear-wheel drive with 250 miles of range for $39,900; dual motor all-wheel drive with 300 miles of range for $49,900; and tri motor all-wheel drive with 500 miles of range for $69,900. Musk said that 42 percent of reservations are dual motor, 41 percent tri motor, and 17 percent single motor.
